This substantial figure has placed her at the top of the list of the highest-paid coaches in women's college basketball for this season.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Her salary is part of a new 10-year contract that she signed following LSU's national championship win. The contract stipulates that by the end of it, Mulkey is scheduled to make $3.65 million by 2032-33.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>This new deal represents an upgrade from the eight-year, $23.6 million contract she initially signed with LSU in 2021, keeping her locked in with the Tigers for four additional years.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Comparative Analysis of Coaching Salaries</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kim Mulkey's salary of $3.264 million at LSU makes her the highest-paid coach in women's college basketball for the 2024 season, surpassing the compensations received by other renowned coaches in the sport.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>UConn's Geno Auriemma and South Carolina's Dawn Staley are right behind Mulkey in compensation, both making $3.1 million this season.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>This places Mulkey at the forefront of women's college basketball coaching salaries, reflecting her high standing in the sport.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Controversies and Contract Terms</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Mulkey's coaching career has not been without controversy, with her tenure at Baylor being marked by several contentious incidents.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite her success, such controversies have been part of her journey.
