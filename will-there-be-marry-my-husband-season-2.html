But, in the era of streaming platforms bringing their honestly jaw-dropping stories to a bigger audience, the pattern has changed. We now have Sweet Home season 2 (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and 3!</a>), The Uncanny Counter season 2, and the next chapter of Extraordinary Attorney is also on its way. So, now, the time-traveling elephant in the room is: Will this apply to the fan-favorite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Marry My Husband</strong></a> as well?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=92 data-current-count=92 data-injectable=false><strong>Spoilers from Marry My Husband season 1 ahead, because I just can’t stop talking about it!</strong></p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>A kind-hearted woman whose husband cheats on her with her best friend plans to cash in her insurance money after she dies from cancer, and ends up accidentally killing her when she catches them in the act. Now, that’s a done-to-death storyline, but here is the twist — this heartbreakingly wronged woman dies and wakes up 10 years before her death, the memory of her future intact, which not only means she has the chance to avert her tragic death and the mental trauma leading up to it, she gets the chance to wreak havoc on her enemies.</p><p data-characters=657 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>The bigger twist than that? She actually manages to land one victory after another against her future husband and her so-called best friend, finds true love, and stands up for other women too in her second chance at having a happy ending. And what makes it a remarkable cocktail? The stellar cast of Marry My Husband — Park Min-Young as Kang Ji-Won rising like a phoenix from her ashes, Na In-Woo as Yoo Ji-Hyuk — the greenest green flag ever; Song Ha-Yoon as the bitter Jung Su-Min plotting to steal everything from Ji-Won; Lee Yi-Kyung as the trashy Park Min-Hwan, Ji-Won’s never-to-be husband who will be facing the punishment for his actions soon.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>For me, that is enough to warrant a second season, but the decision needs a lot more than just me grinning like a clown hopped up on sugar whenever the bad guys fall flat on their faces. For starters, the webtoon Marry My Husband is based on, does its storyline continue long enough to warrant a second-season adaptation?</p><h2 id=h-does-the-marry-my-husband-webtoon-continue-the-story-of-its-characters data-injectable=false>Does the Marry My Husband webtoon continue the story of its characters?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Marry-My-Husband-season-2-1.jpg><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Sadly, no. Even though the show (available to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">watch on Prime Video</a>) hasn’t exactly adhered to the story of the webtoon, and has introduced obvious changes to either drive up the stakes or drum up its pace, it is clearly headed for the conclusion the web novel ends on (hopefully, without any unexpected twists killing the happy ending).</p><p data-characters=73 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Also, so far, there has been no official announcement of a second season.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=74 data-injectable=false>But, but, but, that so doesn’t mean the story can’t continue, does it?</p><h2 id=h-marry-my-husband-could-have-a-season-2 data-injectable=false>Marry My Husband could have a season 2</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=757 data-injectable=true>Yes, the fact stands that officially, there is no word out there regarding a second season of Marry My Husband. But Squid Game, Yumi’s Cells, and many more didn’t have a pre-existing confirmation of season 2 when their first seasons were released. As for the webtoon ending the story of Ji-Won with a neat little bow — that doesn’t have to apply to the show now, does it?</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>In the webtoon, Ji-Won’s path to happiness is pretty straightforward, unlike the show where deadly hurdles (and out-of-the-blue appearances of a crazy ex-fiancée) keep cropping up in her way. And if you ask my inner Sherlock Holmes, it already feels like Min-Hwan will be the one to meet her fate — of dying at the hands of a cheating spouse — as Su-Min and Kim Kyung-Wook (the sexist manager of U&K Foods) will kill him.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>So, why was the ex-fiancée of Ji-Hyuk introduced? For the sake of drama? But why has she gotten so involved in the life of Min-Hwan, orchestrating ways to kill Ji-Won, killing her mother and Su-Min’s father, and so much more? Maybe she is here to cause even more destruction — maybe, she will ensure that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ji-Won doesn’t get her happy ending</a>. That would definitely warrant a Marry My Husband season 2 because Ji-Won being a true lady boss and not letting the bad guys win is exactly why the tvN series is such a hit.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>But further updates about the show’s future are not going to be available soon, no matter how stellar its overall performance ends up being. Business Proposal was 2023’s big wonder hit and yet, chatter about its second season is just speculation even two years later. Waiting, hoping, and biting our nails in apprehension is all we have — for now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tculZK2glaeybq7EZqSaqqKueq7FjKGsrJqRo7Fuv8SaqqimXWd8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwill-there-be-marry-my-husband-season-2.html&text=Will%20there%20be%20Marry%20My%20Husband%20season%202%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwill-there-be-marry-my-husband-season-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwill-there-be-marry-my-husband-season-2.html&title=Will%20there%20be%20Marry%20My%20Husband%20season%202%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwill-there-be-marry-my-husband-season-2.html&title=Will%20there%20be%20Marry%20My%20Husband%20season%202%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwill-there-be-marry-my-husband-season-2.html&title=Will%20there%20be%20Marry%20My%20Husband%20season%202%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwill-there-be-marry-my-husband-season-2.html&description=Will%20there%20be%20Marry%20My%20Husband%20season%202%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-asus-rog-crosshair-viii-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Sharp $430 Impulse on X570">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./richard-hamilton-is-a-nyc-broker-on-million-dollar-listing-new-york.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Richard Hamilton Is A NYC Broker On Million Dollar Listing New York">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
