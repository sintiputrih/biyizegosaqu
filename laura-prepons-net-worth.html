From 2008 through 2013, the G37 served as Infiniti’s entry-level luxury vehicle, succeeding the G35.</p><p>It was offered in coupe, sedan, or convertible body styles, with rear- or all-wheel drive options.</p><p>The G37 competed against the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4, and Lexus IS. However, the G37 brought its own brand of sophisticated luxury to the table, in addition to a powerful engine derived from the brand’s famous VQ Series of engines.</p><p>Its sleek external appearance has kept up well over time, and its attractive interior offers all of the plushness and elegance you’d expect from a luxury vehicle.</p><p>Although it was well-balanced, the 3.7-liter naturally aspirated V6 engine crammed under the hood of the Infiniti G37 was probably the car’s biggest attraction.</p><p>With this powerplant combination, the car reached 60 mph in just 5 seconds and completed the quarter-mile in 13.8 seconds.</p><h4>BMW 3 Series</h4><p>The 2020 BMW 3 Series sedan has a starting price of $40,750. That’s nearly $2,500 more than the median price of a fancy small car. Nevertheless, the BMW 3 Series 2020 is a fantastic vehicle. Engines that are dynamic and responsive are among the performance highlights.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Laura-Prepon-car-image.jpg><p>Thanks to its well-balanced suspension system, this sports sedan is not only entertaining to drive, but it also won’t beat you up after a long day on the road.</p><p>However, it has a few flaws since some rivals outperform the 3 Series in interior extravagances and infotainment use.</p><h4>Toyota Prius</h4><p>The Toyota Prius, due in 2022, is one of the most affordable hybrids and electric vehicles on the market. The base L Eco trim costs $24,525, while the middle trims cost $25,735 and $28,745, respectively. The top-of-the-line Prius Limited costs $32,820.</p><p>It outperforms practically all other hybrid vehicles in terms of fuel efficiency and has a large load space. There’s also plenty of room for comfy seating and a comprehensive list of amenities.</p><p>On the other hand, its driving qualities are less than ideal, with slow acceleration and poor steering responsiveness. As a result, you might think the cabin is a bit shabby.</p><h4>Mercedes S class</h4><p>While a new Mercedes-Benz S-class could previously be had for less than six figures, the new 2021 edition of the full-size luxury car will start at well over $100,000.</p><p>The base price of the 2021 Mercedes S500 4Matic is $110,850, up to $15,650 from the base price of the 2020 model, while the new V-8–powered S580 4Matic starts at $117,350, up to $8905 from the previous S560 4Matic.</p><p>The new S500 isn’t precisely the same as the previous S450 base model, as it now comes standard with all-wheel drive and offers more power from its new inline-six engine, which produces 429 horsepower vs. 362 horsepower from the previous V-6 engine.</p><p>The V-8 in the S580 receives a relatively modest power boost, gaining 33 horsepower for 496 horsepower. A 48-volt hybrid system is standard on both engines.</p><h4>Chevy Suburban</h4><p>The starting price for the 2021 Chevrolet Suburban is $51,700, which is slightly higher than the norm for a large SUV. The price of the top-of-the-line High Country trim level jumps to $75,300.</p><p>The Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia are two less-priced SUVs in this class. However, if you’re looking for a huge SUV, the 2021 Chevrolet Suburban is an excellent option. It’s massive in almost every sense.</p><p>The inside of the Suburban is huge, with seating for up to nine people and more cargo space than any other SUV on the market. Its enormous 10.2-inch touch screen is simple to use, and it comes with a slew of innovation and safety features.</p><p>The Suburban rides well on rocky roads as well, and its powerful gas and diesel engines are capable of towing a trailer and maneuvering the SUV confidently. It even has a generous 10 inches of ground clearance, which is ideal for off-road excursions.</p><h2>Laura Prepon: Lifestyle and Vacation</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Laura Prepon lives an extremely opulent lifestyle because she enjoys shopping.
