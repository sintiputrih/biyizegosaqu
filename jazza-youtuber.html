He published the book Draw With Jazza – Creating Characters: Fun and Easy Guide to Drawing Cartoons and Comics. He also had a series of shorts called Cartoon It Up which was televised on ABC Me and made available on its video watching app. He designed the April Fools Day logo "Googz" for Google Australia in 2018.</p><p>Draw with Jazza videos are uploaded weekly. Topics are mainly drawing tutorials, but also include character designs, speed painting, and art competitions. He presents "art challenges" of various kinds. He inserts comedic commentary over his art project videos. He has also reviewed art software and equipment. His secondary channel Daily Jazza includes daily vlogs where he talks with his community about major events occurring in his life, or behind the scenes looks into his projects. Other channels he has created include It's Tabletop Time, launched in 2015, where he plays role-playing games with his friends; JazzaStudios, where he releases cool animated shorts; JosiahBrooksMusic, for his original music videos.</p><p>Brooks is married and has two children: a son born in 2015 and a daughter born in 2018.</p><p>In 2014, his YouTube channel reached 100,000 subscribers. It was at this time he was able to switch to treating it as a business and doing it full-time. He received a sponsorship from the CEO of Newgrounds. In 2015, Google and Screen Australia granted Brooks AU$100,000 as part of their Skip Ahead initiative program. He joined other YouTubers in Los Angeles to work at YouTube Space and produced a series of short films titled The Tale Teller, which was a three-part mini-documentary that follows "an old man who enters a city with nothing to his name but the stories he has spent his life gathering, which he wishes to pass on before he dies." In 2015, Forbes contributor Don Groves reported that Draw with Jazza had 25 million views with 60% in the United States and 20% in Europe. In 2016, Forbes contributor Rob Salkowitz reported that Draw with Jazza had 573 videos, over 45&nbsp;million views and 658,000 subscribers. In November 2017, Mashable reported that Draw with Jazza had two million subscribers, with 45 percent of them from the US, 12 percent from the UK, 10 from Australia, and some amount from non-English speaking countries and locations such as Germany, the Netherlands, and South America.</p><p>In 2011, he saw that Flash animations were in decline, around the time of the "iPhone era". He looked at his old YouTube channel, and noticed that his art tutorial videos had received the most views. In 2012 he created a new channel which he called Draw with Jazza. He said, "People go online looking for tutorials on how to draw. ... Whenever I looked there was nothing good... they had loud music and voice-overs or were slow and boring." He started with tutorials on drawing the human anatomy. The videos were filmed with a simple webcam and microphone, and had minimal editing. His tutorials have garnered success in views and has also attracted people to his freelance animation business.</p><p>In 2006, when he was 17, he started getting sponsorships from websites for animations, and after graduating high school, he got into producing animation and online video games. He had joined Newgrounds in 2003, and submitted his first game there in 2006. The games were developed using Adobe Flash.</p><p>Josiah <a href=#>Alan Brooks</a> (born 20 April 1989), known online as Jazza (formerly Draw with Jazza), is an Australian YouTuber, artist, animator, and presenter best known for his art tutorials, challenges and animations.
