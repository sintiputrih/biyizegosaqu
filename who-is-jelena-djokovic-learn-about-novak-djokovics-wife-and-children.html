He held the top spot in the global rankings for an unprecedented 373 weeks and set a record seven times as the year's final leader.</p><p>He has won nine Australian Open titles and his 20 Grand Slam men's singles victories. He has amassed 87 ATP singles victories, including 38 Masters events.</p><p>Novak is the first guy in the Open Era to earn a double career Grand Slam and the second man, after Don Budge, to complete a non-calendar year Grand Slam. Additionally, he is the only player on the ATP Tour to accomplish the Career Golden Masters.</p><h2 id=who-is-novak-djokovics-wi>Who Is Novak Djokovic's Wife Jelena Djokovic? Their Age Distinction</h2><p>Tennis player Novak Djokovic was born on May 22, 1987. He is currently 35 years old. Talking about his beautiful wife, Jelena Djokovic, she was born on June 17, 1986. She is 36 years old as of 2022. Jelena is one year older than her&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>husband</a>.</p><p>The couples are very supportive of each other and love each other most. Jelena is famously known as Novak's wife, the world's most ranked tennis player.</p><p>[image-2]</p><p>Due to his vaccination status ahead of the 2022 Australian Open, the Serbian star was refused entrance to Australia on January 5. According to his attorneys, the 34-year-old tennis star was subsequently detained in an immigration detention facility in Melbourne, who claimed he was given a COVID-19 vaccine exemption.</p><p>He was recently freed from this facility on January 10, when he won his appeal. His wife, Jelena Djokovic, has publicly supported him on Twitter and Instagram throughout the scandal.</p><p>Jelena has consistently stood by him during his successful career, but she has also achieved success independently. This 35-year-old woman undoubtedly wears many different hats in addition to her duty as an ever-supportive wife at the courtside.</p><p><strong>You might also like:&nbsp;</strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Is Nick Kyrgios Muslim Or Jewish?
