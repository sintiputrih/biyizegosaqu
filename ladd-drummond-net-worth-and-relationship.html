In addition, he is the spouse of popular author, food show host, and photographer Ree Drummond.</strong></p><p>Ree, Drummond’s lifelong companion, is well-known for her blog Pioneer Woman, where she shares stories about her life on the ranch. She is also well known for hosting The Pioneer Woman on the Food Network.</p><p>Ree, Ladd’s partner, started a line of respectable businesses in the downtown of Pawhuska, Oklahoma, and has written multiple books through her blog. She is also the host of a Food Network series.</p><p>Viewers of Ree’s show The Pioneer Woman frequently get to see her ranch life, which revolves around her husband Ladd Drummond. He is a very busy man who directs and gathers livestock for a significant portion of the day.</p><p>Drummond has spent his entire life working at the ranch, but lately, things have become a little crazy. It seems that Ladd has more to share than only his experiences on the ranch and his expertise in herding cattle.</p><p>Discover everything there is to know about Ree’s spouse, Ladd, including the reasons why her followers are always curious about him. Explore his parents, ancestry, connection with Ree, their kids, and even his financial situation.</p><h2><span id=Ladd_Drummond_Heritage>Ladd Drummond Heritage</span></h2><p>As previously said, Ladd Drummond, who is currently 53 years old, is a fourth-generation cattle rancher. He is descended from Scottish-American ranchers.</p><p>Ronald Thacker Drummond, the great-great-grandfather of AD Ladd, was a well-known businessman in his day after emigrating to the US from Scotland. But his biggest diamond investments were made in South Africa.</p><h2><span id=Ladd_Drummond_Has_Raised_Ranches_Since_He_Was_a_Young_Man>Ladd Drummond Has Raised Ranches Since He Was a Young Man</span></h2><p>Drummond has been employed at the ranch since he was a young lad, where he developed his physical labor, machine operating, and truck driving skills.</p><p>Ladd is currently one of the heirs of the Drummond Land and Cattle Co. estate, which was established in the late 1800s by Fred Drummond, a patriarch of the family.</p><h2><span id=Drummond_Ree_Drummond8217s_spouse>Drummond, Ree Drummond’s spouse.</span></h2><p>Ladd Drummond, husband of The Pioneer Woman host Ree Drummond, is also co-owner of Drummond Land and Cattle Co.</p><p>Moreover, AD Fred founded Drummond Land & Cattle Co. with Addie Genter, a native of Kansas. Three of the late couple’s sons went on to become prosperous cattle ranchers in the future.</p><p>But it’s not clear if Fred was one of the greats or Ladd’s grandfather. Ladd, his father, and his brother Tim are the current partners of the Drummond Land and Cattle Company; Thatcher Drummond, the cousin of the cattleman, is an associate of the property.</p><p>Ladd Drummond, who turns 22 on January 22, is a resident of Pawhuska, Oklahoma. He was born in Nebraska in 1969. He went to Pawhuska High School there.</p><h2><span id=Ladd_Was_In_A_Car_Accident_And_Lost_One_Of_His_Brothers>Ladd Was In A Car Accident And Lost One Of His Brothers</span></h2><p>Todd, one of Ladd’s brothers, was killed in a vehicle crash the summer before he was to go to college when he was eighteen. When Ladd was involved in his accident, his late brother was employed on a family ranch in Texas.</p><p>Ladd’s parents, Chuck Drummond and Nan Olsen appear to be the parents of three sons. He is positioned between his younger sibling, Tim, and his late older brother, Todd. The Scottish-American rancher was raised in Pawhuska, Oklahoma, together with his two brothers.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Between_Ladd_Drummond_and_Reality_Star_Wife_Ree_Drummond>Relationship Between Ladd Drummond and Reality Star Wife Ree Drummond</span></h2><p>Ladd was already a working cattle rancher when Ree got to know him. In the middle of the 1990s, Ladd and the blogger/author got together in a pub. Ree and her companions were out for the evening.</p><p>Ladd Drummond, co-owner of the Drummond estate, with his spouse, Ree Drummond, host of The Pioneer Woman. At the time, Getty Ree had recently graduated from college in Los Angeles and was returning to her hometown of Bartlesville, Oklahoma. At that time, the reality star intended to move to Chicago to further her legal studies, but she ultimately decided to stay with Ladd.</p><p>The marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Drummond took place in September 1996. Following the nuptials, the pair traveled to Australia. The couple lived on a rural working cattle ranch around eight miles west of Pawhuska, Oklahoma, after returning to the United States. Oklahoma City was likewise two hours away.</p><h2><span id=Five_children_are_the_parents_of_Ladd_and_his_spouse_Ree>Five children are the parents of Ladd and his spouse, Ree.</span></h2><p>Five kids total aisthe product of Ladd Drummond, aka The Marlboro Man, and his wife Ree. Their first child, Alex, was born in 1997, and their second child, Paige, was born in 1999.</p><p>In 2002, the couple welcomed their first son, Bryce, as their third child; in 2004, they welcomed their second son, Todd. From kindergarten through high school, all of the Drummond children were homeschooled by their parents.</p><p>Ree and Ladd are parents to four kids as well as their foster son Jamar, whom they accepted into their home in 2019. Fantasy football is a passion for Ladd and his wife as well as all of their children.</p><p>The Pioneer Woman, a reality series starring their matriarch Ree Drummond, featured the family in 2011. In actuality, Ladd has appeared in almost 88 of the 300 episodes of the show. The program debuted on the Food Network in 2011 and has already aired over 400 episodes as of 2022.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_Ladd8217s_Net_Worth_He_Clearly_Has_More_Money_Than_His_Celebrity_Wife>What Is Ladd’s Net Worth? He Clearly Has More Money Than His Celebrity Wife.</span></h2><p>Ladd Drummond, a well-known blogger’s spouse and cattle rancher, is renowned for being wealthy, with estimates placing his net worth comfortably over $200 million. It seems that he is even wealthier than his more well-known spouse, who possessed assets of roughly $50 million.</p><p>The majority of Ladd’s riches came from inheritance from his forefathers; the Sun Devil, who is known for being rather proud, inherited a sizable number of properties.</p><p>In addition, as previously indicated, he and his brother Tim share ownership of the Drummond Land and Cattle Co. Ladd is one of the Drummond company’s four owners. Not to mention that he and his family possess the 23rd most acreage in the US.</p><p>Approximately 433,000 acres, or 675 square miles, are owned by the Drummond family. It’s important to keep in mind that the Drummond family ranks 23rd among US landowners.</p><p>In addition, he has a business partnership with Ree Drummond, his real-life partner. Among his sources of revenue are an ice cream shop called Charlie’s Sweet Shop, a bed and breakfast called The Boarding House, P Town Pizza, and a restaurant and retail store housed in a century-old Pawhuska structure.</p><p>Ladd receives income from the US government in addition to the family companies. It seems that America gives the Drummond estate about $2 million annually to support their efforts to rescue wild horses and burros on their land.</p><p>According to the information, Drummond Land and Cattle Co. has received payments from the Bureau of Land Management totaling more than $25 million since 2006.</p><h2><span id=Ladd_Drumond_A_Dangerous_Incident>Ladd Drumond: A Dangerous Incident</span></h2><p>Ladd, Ree’s husband, was tending to flames that had burned more than 200 acres surrounding the Drummond family property in Pawhuska, Oklahoma, when he had a terrible accident in March 2021. He crashed his huge vehicle.</p><h2><span id=Ladd_Drummond_has_a_200_million_fortune>Ladd Drummond has a $200 million fortune.</span></h2><p>Ladd Drummond, a 53-year-old rancher from Oklahoma, lives with his wife and reality television star Ree Drummond.</p><p>The Sun Devils fan later suffered a broken neck—in two places—after the collision. Ladd had to wear a neck brace for several weeks and undergo surgery to stabilize his neck fractures.</p><h2><span id=Ladd_Drummond_Additional_Information>Ladd Drummond Additional Information</span></h2><ul><li>Ladd Drummond, a cowboy wearing wranglers, was once knocked down by a cow from his own ranch.
