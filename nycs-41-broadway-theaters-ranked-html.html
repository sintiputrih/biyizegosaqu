The only thing a New York City space needs to be anointed by the Broadway League as a true Broadway theater is a minimum of 500 seats (100–499-seat theaters are Off Broadway;&nbsp;1–99-seat theaters – the kind where Emma Stone’s one-woman show in La La Land took place — are Off-Off). The rest is in the eye of the beholder. So what makes a theater magical? Comfy chairs? Ornamentation? Color scheme? An easily navigated lobby bar? Some other indescribable nostalgia-engendering bit of ephemera? Does the dream Broadway theater … exist? How would one even go about determining if it does? Why, by begging, borrowing, and scamming (“I think I left my phone here last night, and my family’s flight back to Wyoming is in two hours!”) one’s way across midtown to appraise and rank all 41 Broadway houses, of course.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cji4su3cz002p3b60hy7x46fp@published data-word-count=209>We tried to be as scientifically sound as we could be in our ranking, but your faithful ranker was only able to fulfill her STEM course requirement in college by taking “The Science of Happiness,” so let’s remember that numbers are hard and it’s the thought that counts. We scored each theater considering five primary factors:&nbsp;(1) location; (2) seating, (3) bathrooms; (4) accessibility, with the help of wonderful artist and walker-user <a href=#>Ryan Haddad</a> (in the event of a tie, we gave the edge to the more easily accessible theater); and (5) overall ambience. Ambience includes décor, famous ghost, and a “wild card” bonus question for modest extra credit: Has Audra McDonald Performed in a Show Here? “Why <a href=#>Audra McDonald</a>?” you may ask, if you are so stupid. “Why Audra McDonald and not [diva who is not Audra McDonald]?” You scurrilous wench, does [diva who is not Audra McDonald] have SIX Antoinette Perry awards? That she won in competition? Before turning 45? No! Only AUDRA does! Only AUDRA could! Audra is the best of Broadway and any theater that she has ensconced in the warmth of her vibrato or simply GRACED with the GIFT of her LINE READINGS eight shows a week deserves to be considered a significant cultural landmark.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cji4su31l002o3b60vrhqj184@published data-word-count=49>One final disclaimer: I, your faithful ranker, love theater, and I love Broadway. I would rather be sitting in the most claustrophobia-inducing Broadway theater than be sprawled out comfortably most anywhere else in the world, and even the lowest-ranked of these theaters is sacred to me. NOW. Let’s blaspheme.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cji4svdus00333b60k6nqpxw8@published>41.

The Hayes is tiny and seems to delight in your discomfort; it is Rumpelstiltskin, but a place. The seats are so close to each other that the aftershocks of you uncrossing your legs will reverberate throughout your entire row. The theater will next house <a href=#>Straight White Men</a> starring Armie “A Tree, But Fuckable??” Hammer, and I hope to see photos of him trying to squeeze into one of those seats in the audience during notes, like a porn parody of Gulliver’s Travels.

So it’s sort of fun and immersive for Snowpiercer, but then you’re sitting and watching Moonlight and wondering if there’s an earthquake plot twist coming up and then you find out later that part was supposed to be completely silent and you’re like “Oh, yeah, that probably would have been very effective dramatically”? The American Airlines is the Angelika for live theater. Located smack dab in the middle of 42nd Street, it is constantly plagued by outside noise, and unfortunately, is often home to small plays that are not served by persistent interruptions of 21st-century cacophony.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cji4thhzq001o3b60ctnv8ab2@published>39.

To sit in the balcony is to be stuck atop a Ferris wheel, frightened and far from your friends below. Sight lines are also tough; I’ve heard from numerous people that they sat too far back at the recent <a href=#>Sunset Boulevard</a> revival and couldn’t see Glenn Close’s entrance, making the five to seven hours it took her to descend several tiers of steampunk scaffolding an extended production of Waiting for Godot.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cji4tki3g00353b60yyyhagp9@published>37.

This theater makes no effort; it knows that if you’re here, you’re here to stumble in a little drunk and see whatever star of the moment they’ve squeezed into tights and a leotard. Because of the lacking lobby situation, the area outside gets completely overrun with people anxious to see the cast of Vanderpump Rules do “Cell Block Tango.” (That hasn’t happened yet but it is conceptually phenomenal.)</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cji4tnr8300433b6078x0943t@published>36.

Accessibility points. Points for the fact that it is a theater made from the bones and ash of Studio 54, so you know there are ghosts everywhere. Coked up ghosts. Coked up celebrity ghosts&nbsp;(a friend of mine is absolutely convinced he saw Truman Capote watching Cabaret a few feet away from him.) It’s also located a block away from the 55th street exit at the 57th/7th subway stop, so you can mosey over to your theater at a leisurely pace and stare downtown to admire the hustle and bustle from afar/thank your lucky stars you aren’t currently on 47th trying to figure out how you got stuck behind a fleet of baby strollers. Bonus Audra credit for 110 in the Shade, which is the show I saw in high school that made me want to be an actor (this would be a more inspiring addendum if I were a famous actor).</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cji4vb6rp02j53b60dqmu3rys@published>3.

The signage outside is like a delightful old-timey diner, acoustics are wonderful, sight lines are great, and the stage is now a flourishing garden watered by the tears of any and all <a href=#>Evan Hansens</a>. Audra starred in <a href=#>Shuffle Along</a> here while pregnant with Will Swenson’s baby, so the Music Box is essentially Broadway Nazareth.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cji4vc91d02nv3b60vmuyurwe@published>2.

You want architecture? You want to be ENVELOPED in CULTURE? If the Marquis is a cruise ship, then the Beaumont is how I imagine <a href=#>Amal Clooney’s husband’s</a> villa on Lake Como. It lost a couple points for seating (too close together for my blood, though sight lines are wonderful) and ambience (the subscribers can seem like country club extras in Caddyshack), but it was able to stage a glorious comeback because, well … “Has Audra performed here”? Tender heart, Audra has taken to the Beaumont in not one, not two, but THREE different productions — Carousel, Marie Christine, and Henry IV. Lincoln Center belongs to Audra (she hosts their PBS specials like Jackie O giving tours of the White House). The Beaumont is a pied-à-terre she sometimes very generously Airbnbs to Barlett Sher.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cji4vdmo502rg3b60b0j4p1oz@published>1.

The Rodgers is a stunning space. It is the quintessential Broadway theater you imagine when you’re hypothetically growing up in Northern Virginia unsuccessfully feigning interest in “lacrosse” at school, but rushing home each day to scour LiveJournal for bootlegs of the 2001 Actor’s Fund Dreamgirls concert. The design is baroque by way of Broadway with elements of the Greco-Roman; plush red velvet, gold patterns, gorgeous murals, the works. The theater’s exterior has now become arguably even more iconic than the inside, with <a href=#>the Ham4Ham shows</a> making it recognizable to nerds across America and establishing the Rodgers as reigning queen bee (but a benevolent one!) of a densely populated theater block. The Rodgers made Hamilton feel like a timeless classic from day one; Hamilton made the Rodgers about as “cool” as a Broadway theater can be. They are an ideal match, which makes it even more heartbreaking that the show is doing so badly and will be closing any moment. Let’s hope this win gives them the momentum to stay afloat.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>All 41 Broadway Theaters, Ranked</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocWdga3yvxcKsZG1pXZe%2FsK3DsJiyZaSdsqLAxKuqZqqRo7imsI2hq6ak</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnycs-41-broadway-theaters-ranked-html.html&text=All%2041%20Broadway%20Theaters%2c%20Ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnycs-41-broadway-theaters-ranked-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnycs-41-broadway-theaters-ranked-html.html&title=All%2041%20Broadway%20Theaters%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnycs-41-broadway-theaters-ranked-html.html&title=All%2041%20Broadway%20Theaters%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnycs-41-broadway-theaters-ranked-html.html&title=All%2041%20Broadway%20Theaters%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnycs-41-broadway-theaters-ranked-html.html&description=All%2041%20Broadway%20Theaters%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./http-server-gave-http-response-to-https-client.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./best-modern-war-movies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 action movies to watch like Guy Ritchie's The Covenant">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
