For decades, the Appalachian Mountains have been the source of mysterious sightings and stories. Centered around the Appalachian mountains, the reality TV series “Mountain Monsters,” either attempts to bust the hoax or confirm the sightings. The series features a band of hardcore hunters, who take it upon themselves to bring light to the mysterious sightings. Jacob Lowe is one of those hunters, who has been at it for a long time. In this article we will bring everything to know about this reality television star.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Fact</th><th>Value</th></tr><tbody readability=23.5><tr><td>Full name</td><td>Jacob Lowe</td></tr><tr><td>Nickname</td><td>Buck</td></tr><tr><td>Date of birth</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td>Place of birth</td><td>West Virginia, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td>Height (approx)</td><td>5 feet 7 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Hair color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye color</td><td>Hazel</td></tr><tr><td>Marital status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Christine Stein</td></tr><tr><td>Wedding date</td><td>May 12, 2018</td></tr><tr><td>Wedding location</td><td>Omaha, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>None</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Occupation</td><td>Reality TV star, Actor, Hunter, Trapper</td></tr><tr><td>Net worth</td><td>$600,000</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>TV shows</td><td>Mountain Monsters, A Murder in the Park</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Role in Mountain Monsters</td><td>Researcher and tracker of unidentified creatures in the Appalachian Mountains</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Team name in Mountain Monsters</td><td>Appalachian Investigators of Mysterious Sightings (A.I.M.S.)</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Team members in Mountain Monsters</td><td>John “Trapper” Tice, Jeff Headlee, Willy McQuillian, Joseph “Huckleberry” Lott, William “Wild Bill” Neff</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>First appearance in Mountain Monsters</td><td>Season 1 Episode 1: “Wolfman of Wolfe County” (June 22, 2013)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Original nickname in Mountain Monsters</td><td>Rookie</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Current nickname in Mountain Monsters</td><td>Buck</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Signature weapon in Mountain Monsters</td><td>Rifle</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Theme song in Mountain Monsters</td><td>“Mountain Man Town” by Last American Cowboys</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Narrator of Mountain Monsters</td><td>Michael Berger</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Genre of Mountain Monsters</td><td>Reality Television, Cryptozoology</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jacob-Lowe-Mountain-Monsters.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A life of secrecy</h2><p>Jacob Lowe, also known by the name Jake is a man of secrets. He has revealed very little about himself and is not too keen on sharing. As a result, media outlets have been able to glean little to no information from the man. What makes this even more difficult is that Jacob Lowe doesn’t like social media. As a result things like his date of birth, parents, and siblings, have never come to light. Judging from his outer appearance, Jacob seems to be in his mid-30s. As he is incredibly familiar with the mountain terrain, a possible explanation for this could be his upbringing in the remotes of West Virginia where he was also born.&nbsp;Other than that, nothing is known about Jacob’s early life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>All an act?</h2><p>After a few seasons of Mountain Monsters, fans began to ask the question if the series was all an act. The rumors were particularly fueled by Jack’s repertoire. While there is little information on Jack’s life as a hunter, his acting exploits are for all to see. Before making an appearance on Mountain Monsters, Jack worked on a documentary entitled, “A Murder In The Park.” Combining this with the seemingly mythical occurrences in the show, fans began to speculate if the show was all an act.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Life on Mountain Monsters</h2><p>Jacob Lowe went from a seemingly normal person to a reality star in a span of a few days. While Jacob had one or two acting credits to his name, it was nothing compared to Mountain Monsters. Jacob is one of the original six <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hunters to feature</a> in the series. A part of Appalachian Investigators of Mysterious Sightings (AIMS), Jacob is often the first one charging into combat. There is not much that can faze Jacob. His actions on the set have earned Jacob the nickname of “Buck”. Similar to the animal his name represents, Jacob is headstrong and is ready to put on a shift.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jacob-Lowe.jpg><p>Jacob joined the cast of Mountain Monsters during the first seasons in 2013. The reality TV star has been consistent and has been a big part of every season until now.</p><p>The eighth season of Mountain Monsters concluded on March 13, 2022, and judging by the reception from the fans one more season is likely to follow. Whatever the future may hold, Jacob has already proven to be an important part of the show. He has appeared in 80 episodes from 2013 to 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wight loss</h2><p>One of the most recognizable features of Jacob, other than his headstrong nature is his size. The man weighed quite a lot and had to face several health problems due to his size. Over the years, Jacob has worked to get his weight under control. He has lost a considerable amount of weight and the results are for all to see.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wife and children:</h2><p>Jacob has never revealed any details about his personal life that does not mean he has not one. Jacob is a married man. Jacob and his wife Christine Stein tied the knot on May 12, 2018, in Omaha, USA. The wedding ceremony was attended by family and close friends. So far Jacob and his wife don not have any children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Social Media Presence:</h2><p>For the longest time, Jacob kept his fans at bay, but as things started to get out of hand, the reality TV star had no option but to come forward. Due to his absence on social media, a number of fake Facebook accounts under his name pounced on popularity, to sell merchandise related to AIMS. Ultimately, it forced Jacob to come out of hiding and create a Facebook page that goes by the name “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buck-Mountain Monsters</a>.” Jacob has been vocal about accounts selling unauthorized merchandise under his name.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>By profession, Jacob Lowe is a hunter and a reality television actor. Apart from television, Jacob adds income from the sale of merchandise. For now, the showrunners have not given out the exact salaries of cast members but we can always derive based on finance information. According to BusinessInsider, “A” players on a cable reality show make somewhere between $30,000 to $10 million per season, “B” players on a cable reality show make $15,000 to $35,000 per season, and “C” players on a cable reality show: $0 to $12,000 per season. Unlike talent shows, we are talking about “Mountain Monsters,” although Jacob is an “A” player, his salary per season is likely to come close to lower than the upper limit. As of 2023, Jacob Lowe has a reported net worth of $450,000.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>FAQs</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Question</th><th>Answer</th></tr><tbody readability=92><tr readability=5><td>What is Jacob Lowe’s nickname on Mountain Monsters?</td><td>Jacob Lowe’s nickname on Mountain Monsters is Buck.
