He was equally raised there. He graduated from Massapequa High School in 1999 before he enrolled in the US Marine Corps boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina.</p><p>Contrary to popular assumptions that h has no culinary training, it is reported that he specialized in culinary arts at some point in his life.</p><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>Tom Vitale And Valerie Bertinelli Divorce- Here Is Everything We Know</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Joseph_Tinnelly_was_Involved_in_a_Controversy_on_Kitchens_Hell></span><strong>Joseph Tinnelly was Involved in a Controversy on Kitchen’s Hell</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hell’s Kitchen season 6 was aired from July 21 to October 13 2009 on Fox and it had 17 contestants. At the end of the show, the winner was to go home with $250,000 in cash and also a position at the Araxi Restaurant in Whistler, Canada.</p><p>During season 6 of the show, Tinnelly, who was reportedly uncooperative when answering questions, started an argument with the host of the show after he was asked to announce the names that his group had nominated.</p><p>His attitude and tone infuriated Ramsey, who in turn yelled at Joseph but that only got him angrier and he reportedly removed his jacket and asked the host for a fight. Just as he was walking aggressively toward Ramsay, two members of the crew went forward and intervene to avoid any physical contact.</p><p>Joseph continued to call Ramsay all sorts of names like ‘bitch’, the latter on the other hand to him he had no respect and then eliminated him from the competition. His exit marked one of the most intense exits of all time in Hell’s Kitchen.</p><p>Although they did not fight physically, the episode became one of the most infamous moments in the history of the show.</p><p>After he was escorted outside, he allegedly gave a very insulting exit interview while having a cigarette. During the interview, he stated that any restaurant would employ him regardless.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Joseph_Tinnellys_Fight_on_Hells_Kitchen_Staged></span><strong>Was Joseph Tinnelly’s Fight on Hell’s Kitchen Staged?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><p>According to reports, Gordon Ramsay is an intense person so most times, fans of the show are always eager to know if things escalate on the show. Before the altercation between Joseph and Gordon, almost the same thing happened during season 5 between Gordon and another contestant, Giovani.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>producers of the show</a> have insisted that the show is not staged. However, Hell’s Kitchen uses a script for the host, Gordon Ramsay, when he explains or delivers a challenge. Nevertheless, when he is reacting to a dish or speaking to chefs he does not use a script.</p><p>There are quite a number of reports that say otherwise. Netizens tend to believe the fight was just a ploy to pump up ratings for Hell’s Kitchen.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_to_Joseph_Tinnelly_and_Where_Is_He_Now></span><strong>What Happened to Joseph Tinnelly and Where Is He Now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following his elimination from Hell’s Kitchen, Joseph Tinnelly took up a job as an Executive Chef and also became the part-owner of the famous American Beauty Bistro located in North Massapequa New York. His resume also includes working at Mitch and Toni’s in Albertson.</p><p>Also, he later became the executive chef at uncle Jack’s Steakhouse. After Taste American Grill opened in Massapequa Park in 2017, Joseph Tinnelly became the&nbsp; Executive Chef in the kitchen.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, the chef has been lip-tight about his family but it seems he has a partner. His Instagram profile picture insinuates so.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Quick_Facts_about_the_Joseph_Tinnelly_While_he_was_a_Hells_Kitchen_Contestant></span><strong>Quick Facts about the Joseph Tinnelly While he was a&nbsp; Hell’s Kitchen Contestant</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Joseph Tinnelly has the shortest tenure record for any contestant in the history of the show</li><li>His portrait on Kitchen’s Hell was never seen making him the second contestant to have that record</li><li>He is the first male contestant to voluntarily withdraw from the competition at elimination</li><li>He is the second contestant to be confronted by Ramsay during the Signature Dish Challenge</li><li>Be the first to ever try to physically fight Chef Gordons, he also made the most shocking exit in the history of the show.</li></ul><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51kt7C%2FxKmfZqyZo7umuMuyZJynnqm%2FsMLEq6qyZaedxm60xGajnp6kYrWmuMusZKShpJi1prqMsJ%2BeqpVitrR5x55m</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoseph-tinnelly-controversy-why-he-left-hells-kitchen-where-is-he.html&text=Joseph%20Tinnelly-%20Controversy%2c%20Why%20He%20Left%20Hell%27s%20Kitchen%2c%20Where%20Is%20He%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoseph-tinnelly-controversy-why-he-left-hells-kitchen-where-is-he.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoseph-tinnelly-controversy-why-he-left-hells-kitchen-where-is-he.html&title=Joseph%20Tinnelly-%20Controversy%2c%20Why%20He%20Left%20Hell%27s%20Kitchen%2c%20Where%20Is%20He%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoseph-tinnelly-controversy-why-he-left-hells-kitchen-where-is-he.html&title=Joseph%20Tinnelly-%20Controversy%2c%20Why%20He%20Left%20Hell%27s%20Kitchen%2c%20Where%20Is%20He%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoseph-tinnelly-controversy-why-he-left-hells-kitchen-where-is-he.html&title=Joseph%20Tinnelly-%20Controversy%2c%20Why%20He%20Left%20Hell%27s%20Kitchen%2c%20Where%20Is%20He%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoseph-tinnelly-controversy-why-he-left-hells-kitchen-where-is-he.html&description=Joseph%20Tinnelly-%20Controversy%2c%20Why%20He%20Left%20Hell%27s%20Kitchen%2c%20Where%20Is%20He%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./larry-black-wikipedia-biography-age-height-weight-net-worth-in-2021-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Larry Black Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Height, Weight, Net Worth and more">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./promise-pegasus-r6-mac-thunderbolt-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="It's Bootable &amp;amp; Power/Thermals/Noise - Promise Pegasus R6 &amp;amp; Mac Thunderbolt Review">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
