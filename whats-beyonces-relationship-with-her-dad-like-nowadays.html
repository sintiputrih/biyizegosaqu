But over the years, it seemed like the two had been on some rift.In 2011, the Renaissance artist dropped her dad as her manager, with the latter saying at that time: "Business is business and family is family," her father said. "It should come as no surprise that at 29 years old, almost 30, she wants to have more control of her business."Despite the amicable nature of the professional split, fans couldn't help but speculate that there was a lot more to it. Mathew and <a href=#>Beyoncé's mother, Tina Knowles</a>, notably finalized their divorce that same year.They broke up in 2009 after news broke that Mathew had fathered a "love child" with actress Alexsandra White during their marriage. Rumors of his rift with the <a href=#>multi-millionaire singer</a> grew when she and <a href=#>her sister Solange</a> didn't attend his wedding to Gena Charmaine Avery in 2013.Here's the truth about Beyoncé's relationship with her dad.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The One Talk Show Host The Claims Beyonce Sounds Like A "Fifth Grader"</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-beyonc-eacute-fired-her-dad-mathew-knowles-as-a-manager>Why Beyoncé Fired Her Dad Mathew Knowles As A Manager</h2><p>Following the announcement, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mathew told Us Weekly</a> that he and his wife "mutually agreed to part ways in terms of me managing Beyoncé, as my focus is in the investment of Music World Entertainment's growing gospel and inspirational music division. Because of the success of these artists, my focus has to be on gospel now."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fzrk_mfx0aerhc1.jpeg><p>The Halo hitmaker also clarified that it was all a professional move. "I've only parted ways with my father on a business level," she told the magazine. "He is my father for life and I love my dad dearly. I am grateful for everything he has taught me. I grew up watching both he and my mother manage and own their own businesses. They were hard-working entrepreneurs and I will continue to follow in their footsteps."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beyonce-39-s-most-iconic-looks>Beyonce's Most Iconic Looks</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, TMZ famously discovered that the decision came after "Beyoncé had her law firm conduct an audit, and the law firm concluded Mathew had indeed pilfered money from her." At that time, "Mathew insists the theft accusations by Live Nation are false, and he wants the judge to give him the right to take depositions of various people at Live Nation, to determine just how they concluded he was a thief."<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Jennifer Lopez And Beyonce?</a></span></p><h2 id=inside-beyonc-eacute-39-s-current-relationship-with-dad-mathew-knowles>Inside Beyoncé's Current Relationship With Dad Mathew Knowles</h2><p>Beyoncé's team refused to comment on the theft accusations back then (wisely so). In 2016, the singer compared her dad and husband, <strong><a href=#>Jay-Z</a></strong> (following his cheating scandal) in LEMONADE's section, Accountability.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ef4f_5ewsaej5zv.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans couldn't help but assume she still had a complicated relationship with Mathew. But in her song, Daddy Lessons, the Break My Soul performer sings about her dad teaching her how to shoot a gun and become an achiever.The following year, it seemed like Mathew didn't have any contact with Beyoncé, he had to send his birthday greetings via social media. "I love you with all my heart. I just wanted to tell you happy birthday," he said at that time. In 2019, following his breast cancer diagnosis, he informed Us that he and his daughter are on good terms."I have a great relationship as a father with not just Beyoncé," he said, noting that her sister is someone to watch as well. "But people forget I have this talented, gifted kid named Solange, who is a Grammy winner and has had a number one album. People tend to think she does not exist."<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Meghan Trainor Offered A Song To Beyoncé (But It's A Good Thing She Turned It Down)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mathew-knowles-wants-quot-one-last-album-quot-from-destiny-39-s-child>Mathew Knowles Wants "One Last Album" From Destiny's Child</h2><p>In 1995, Mathew quit his job as a medical equipment salesman to fully commit his time to managing Destiny's Child. In April 2023, he wrote a lengthy post on Instagram, talking about supporting his daughters since day 1."When Beyoncé and Solange showed an interest in music at a very young age, Tina and I (who were already corporate professionals and entrepreneurs) didn't attempt to downplay their passions," he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fxb8m8awcagr1nd.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Rather, we encouraged them, we guided them, we supported them," he continued. "As long as they took it seriously and strived to be the best they could, we were happy with whatever career path they chose." He concluded the post by saying that having more people "connected to their inner ambitions and passions, and are surrounded by those who nurture them" will "make the world a better place for us all."The following month, Mathew also expressed his interest in reuniting the girl group for "one last album". Although it's "a decision that the ladies would have to make," he told Entertainment Tonight that he "would certainly, certainly support that decision as I still manage Destiny's Child. I would love to see that as well."He added that it would be a huge hit among fans. "I think the fans will be just overjoyed, overwhelmed," he said. "And hopefully they do one last time in their career. Hopefully they give us one last album. Who knows? You never know. You never say it can't happen. Because this is entertainment. A lot of things can happen."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkqHqjsdiopZydo2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF51qKroWWYmr9usMCdZKWhm5p6r7vWmpuasaNk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhats-beyonces-relationship-with-her-dad-like-nowadays.html&text=What%27s%20Beyonc%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Dad%20Like%20Nowadays%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhats-beyonces-relationship-with-her-dad-like-nowadays.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhats-beyonces-relationship-with-her-dad-like-nowadays.html&title=What%27s%20Beyonc%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Dad%20Like%20Nowadays%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhats-beyonces-relationship-with-her-dad-like-nowadays.html&title=What%27s%20Beyonc%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Dad%20Like%20Nowadays%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhats-beyonces-relationship-with-her-dad-like-nowadays.html&title=What%27s%20Beyonc%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Dad%20Like%20Nowadays%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhats-beyonces-relationship-with-her-dad-like-nowadays.html&description=What%27s%20Beyonc%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Dad%20Like%20Nowadays%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-is-ellie-immune.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Is Ellie Immune?
