This is a relatively new crossbreed that was developed in the early 2000s. This adorable dog is a cross between a <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Beagle</a> and an <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>English Bulldog</a>. It is thought that the original breeders wanted to elongate the muzzle of the loveable bulldog to create a sturdy, chunky dog with a loyal disposition.</p><h2><span id=Breed_Overview>Breed Overview</span></h2><p>Height</p><p>12 – 16 inches</p><p>Weight</p><p>30 – 60 pounds</p><p>Lifespan</p><p>10 – 13 years</p><p>Colors</p><p>Brown and white, tri-colored, golden, white</p><p>Suitable for</p><p>Experienced dog owners, active families</p><p>Temperament</p><p>Friendly, playful, patient, strong-willed, stubborn, mischievous, loyal & loving</p><p>The typical Beabull has the Beagle’s floppy ears and brown or hazel eyes and the English Bulldog’s wrinkles, underbite, thick torso, and wide hips. You won’t find it hard to love a Beabull because this breed is charming, affectionate, and friendly with people and other pets including dogs and cats.</p><p><span id=yasr-multi-set-admin-explain-with-id-readonly><h2><span id=Beabulls_Characteristics>Beabulls Characteristics</span></h2><p><span class=stars-rating-multiset__field__name>Energy:</span></p><p>+</p><p>High-energy dogs will need a lot of mental and physical stimulation to stay happy and healthy, while low-energy dogs require minimal physical activity. It’s important when choosing a dog to make sure their energy levels match your lifestyle or vice versa.</p><p><span class=stars-rating-multiset__field__name>Trainability:</span></p><p>+</p><p>Easy-to-train dogs are more skilled at learning prompts and actions quickly with minimal training. Dogs that are harder to train will require a bit more patience and practice.</p><p><span class=stars-rating-multiset__field__name>Health:</span></p><p>+</p><p>Some dog breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems, and some more than others. This doesn’t mean that every dog will have these issues, but they have an increased risk, so it’s important to understand and prepare for any additional needs they may require.</p><p><span class=stars-rating-multiset__field__name>Lifespan:</span></p><p>+</p><p>Some breeds, due to their size or their breeds potential genetic health issues, have shorter lifespans than others. Proper exercise, nutrition, and hygiene also play an important role in the lifespan of your pet.</p><p><span class=stars-rating-multiset__field__name>Sociability:</span></p><p>+</p><p>Some dog breeds are more social than others, both towards humans and other dogs. More social dogs have a tendency to run up to strangers for pets and scratches, while less social dogs shy away and are more cautious, even potentially aggressive. No matter the breed, it’s important to socialize your dog and expose them to lots of different situations.</p></span></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64></p><h2><span id=Beabull_Puppies>Beabull Puppies</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64><p>Because the Beabull is a new breed that’s only been around for about 20 years, the puppies are somewhat rare. Due to their scarcity, people breeding Beabulls know they can charge top dollar for these puppies.</p><p>The demand for puppies has increased over the last few years, which has pushed the cost of puppies upward and sometimes to ridiculous amounts. So it is best to have a lot of patience and do your homework with the research of the right breeder for your Beabull puppy.</p><p>Be sure to read the Beabull’s full care guide, so you know what type of food and exercise they need to grow into healthy and happy pups! These designer dogs are generally strong and healthy, making them great pets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2><span id=Temperament_Intelligence_of_the_Beabull>Temperament & Intelligence of the Beabull</span></h2><p>The Beabull is friendly, even-tempered, and intelligent. These dogs are known to have a stubborn streak that comes from the English Bulldog side. This dog is generally calm and very loyal but can be obstinate when training or learning something new. It takes patience and perseverance to train a Beabull but this dog loves to eat so it responds well to food reinforcement.</p><p>The Beabull is friendly towards everyone he meets, including children. This is a dog that will cherish his family and enjoy following them around all day, followed by snuggling up beside them in the evening. These dogs love being shown attention and affection. While not known to be a great watchdog, a Beabull is a wonderful companion dog that wouldn’t hesitate to defend his family if he had to.</p><h3><span id=Are_These_Dogs_Good_for_Families>Are These Dogs Good for Families? 👪</span></h3><p>Because Beabulls are friendly, they make wonderful family dogs. They have a lot of patience for the antics of children and love running and playing with youngsters. While this dog may be a bit challenging to train, it can be done with patience and persistence. When you allow a Beabull to join your family, you’ll have a loyal and loving friend who will love hanging out with everyone in the clan.</p><h3><span id=Does_This_Breed_Get_Along_with_Other_Pets><strong>Does This Breed Get Along with Other Pets?</strong></span></h3><p>Beabulls get along very well with other pets like dogs and cats. Of course, it will take time for a Beabull to get used to having another pet around. To make things go smoothly when introducing your Beabull to another pet, be patient and give your pets time to get used to one another. Keep a close eye on the situation at first then allow them to have some time unsupervised. Before you know it, your Beabull and other pet will be the best of buds!</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></p><h2><span id=Things_to_Know_When_Owning_a_Beabull>Things to Know When Owning a Beabull:</span></h2><p>Bringing a Beabull into your life is a big responsibility you should never take lightly. Your Beabull will be depending on you to provide him with a wonderful life. That’s why you should know what your dog needs to live a happy and healthy life.</p><h3><span id=Food_Diet_Requirements>Food & Diet Requirements 🦴</span></h3><p>The ideal Beabull diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with medium energy. This dog tends to eat rapidly and over-eat. That’s why it is important to monitor what your Beabull is eating. To ensure that your Beabull doesn’t pack on the pounds, stick to a regular feeding schedule and only feed your pooch a good quality dog food. It is fine to give your Beabull treats now and then, but don’t overdo it.</p><h3><span id=Exercise>Exercise 🐕</span></h3><p>The Beabull is not an overly active dog, but it does need regular exercise. This dog should be allowed to take at least two long walks a day. If possible, visit a dog park so you Beabull can run free with other dogs. A happy and healthy Beabull is one that gets plenty of regular exercise. While this dog won’t want to run a marathon with you, he will be more than willing to join you for a nice long hike in the woods or a stroll through the city.</p><p>Beabulls love to play fetch and they adore kids. If you have kids, encourage them to include your Beabull in their outdoor activities. These fun-loving dogs make wonderful playmates and they’re game for just about any activity you can dream up.</p><h3><span id=Training>Training 🎾</span></h3><p>As stated earlier, Beabulls have a stubborn side which makes this breed challenging to train. If you can’t get your Bebull interested in training, sign up for a dog training course the two of you can attend. The Beabull is a dog that wants to please its owner so be patient and come up with some fun training ideas that seem more like play.</p><h3><span id=Grooming>Grooming ✂️</span></h3><p>If dog grooming isn’t your thing, you’ll be pleased to know that the Beabull is an easy dog to groom. These short-haired dogs do shed quite a bit, especially during the springtime. That’s why you should get into the habit of brushing your Beabull at least every other day. Use a firm-bristled brush and go over every part of your dog’s body to smooth the coat and keep it looking nice.</p><p>You should only bathe your Beabull when he’s dirty as too much bathing can dry out the skin. Take the time once a month or so to clean those long floppy ears with a warm washcloth to remove any accumulated dirt and debris. By regularly cleaning your dog’s ears, he’ll be less prone to developing ear infections.</p><h3><span id=Health_and_Conditions>Health and Conditions 🏥</span></h3><p>Beabulls are generally strong and healthy dogs. However, they are susceptible to some health problems you should be aware of.</p><p>Serious Conditions</p><ul><li>Hip Dysplasia</li><li>Hypothyroidism</li><li>Intervertebral Disk Disease</li><li>Patellar Luxation</li></ul><p>Minor Conditions</p><ul><li>Obesity</li><li>Digestive Issues</li><li>Ear infections</li><li>Cataracts</li></ul><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></p><h2><span id=Male_vs_Female>Male vs Female</span></h2><p>If you can’t decide if you should get a male or female Beabull, here are some things to consider. Female Beabulls tend to be smaller than their male counterparts and are more likely to want you to pamper them. The males like attention too but tend to know when enough is enough. Once you’re done petting and making over a male Beabull, he’d likely be more than happy to spend time on his own.</p><h3><span id=i><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></h3><h2><span id=3_Little-Known_Facts_About_the_Beabulls>3 Little-Known Facts About the Beabulls</span></h2><h3 class=num-head><span id=1_The_Beabull_is_a_Designer_Dog><span class=dhn>1.</span> The Beabull is a Designer Dog</span></h3><p>The Beabull is <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>one part English Bulldog</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>one part Beagle</a>, and two parts adorable. This mixed breed with the charming personality is considered a designer dog. What that means is simply that the Beabull is a cross between two purebred dogs. Many people think of tiny dogs as designer dogs like <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow>Chiweenies</a> or <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow>Chorkies</a> but the Beabull belongs in this classification too!</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=2_Their_Appearance_Can_Vary_Considerably><span class=dhn>2.</span> Their Appearance Can Vary Considerably</span></h3><p>Because Beabulls are mixed breed dogs, you’ll never be sure of what you’ll get when you cross an English Bulldog with a Beagle. Some Beabull puppies in a litter may look more like a Beagle while others will look just like their English Bulldog relatives. This is the case with all mixed breeds as puppies born within seconds of each other can look completely different from one another.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=3_They_Can_Be_Challenging_to_Train><span class=dhn>3.</span> They Can Be Challenging to Train</span></h3><p>There’s no denying that a Beabull is charming with its big eyes and floppy ears but this adorable dog can be a challenge to train. It’s not that the Beabull is dumb. This is an intelligent dog that knows how to follow instructions. However, sometimes this dog would simply rather be doing something else than training. If you get a Beabull, be patient during your training sessions and use lots of <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow>positive reinforcement</a>.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64></p><h2><span id=Final_Thoughts>Final Thoughts</span></h2><p>If you’re looking for a cute and charming dog that is friendly and fun-loving, you can’t go wrong with the Beabull. Even though this mixed breed has a stubborn side and can be tricky to train, it makes a wonderful family dog and a loyal companion. If you’re dead set on getting a Beabull, be sure you have the time to dedicate to training and are willing to provide your dog with lots of regular exercise.</p><p>The Beabull loves spending time with his owners and is a relatively easy dog to care for. This dog can just as happily live in an apartment or a house, as long as he’s allowed to exercise regularly. Beabulls are intelligent and love challenges so consider signing up for agility training or <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow>nosework</a> classes to keep your pooch active and happy.</p><p class="text-light-gray text-small">Featured Image Credit: JStaley401, Shutterstock</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolam4prHNZ5qopV%2BXsqKu1KWjaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbeabull.html&text=Beabull%20%28Beagle%20%26amp%3b%20English%20Bulldog%20Mix%29%3a%20Pictures%2c%20Info%20%26amp%3b%20Care&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbeabull.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbeabull.html&title=Beabull%20%28Beagle%20%26amp%3b%20English%20Bulldog%20Mix%29%3a%20Pictures%2c%20Info%20%26amp%3b%20Care" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbeabull.html&title=Beabull%20%28Beagle%20%26amp%3b%20English%20Bulldog%20Mix%29%3a%20Pictures%2c%20Info%20%26amp%3b%20Care" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbeabull.html&title=Beabull%20%28Beagle%20%26amp%3b%20English%20Bulldog%20Mix%29%3a%20Pictures%2c%20Info%20%26amp%3b%20Care" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbeabull.html&description=Beabull%20%28Beagle%20%26amp%3b%20English%20Bulldog%20Mix%29%3a%20Pictures%2c%20Info%20%26amp%3b%20Care" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lil-nas-x-revealed-to-james-corden-why-he-wont-date-celebs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lil Nas X Revealed To James Corden The Real Reason Why He Won't Date Celebs Anymore">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./aaron-hernandezs-fiancee-shayanna-slams-tom-bradys-jokes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aaron Hernandezs Fiancee Shayanna Slams Tom Bradys Jokes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
