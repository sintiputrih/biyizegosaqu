The start of their relationship attracted a lot of media, and controversy their way.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-riches-of-jennifer-mcdaniel></span>The Riches of Jennifer McDaniel<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of mid-2020, Jennifer McDaniel’s net worth is estimated to be over $4 million, partly earned through work as a make-up artist.</p><p>The majority of her wealth probably comes from the benefit of being the wife of one of the most famous professional wrestlers in history – Hulk Hogan has a net worth estimated to be over $25 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=life-and-controversial-relationship></span>Life and Controversial Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While not many details are available about Jennifer’s life before meeting Hogan, it is known that she previously worked as a make-up artist. The two started their relationship sometime in 2008, and it immediately caught the attention of the media and paparazzi. Hogan didn’t hide her from the public, as she appeared with him on vacations, shopping trips, and the like.</p><p>This gained a lot of attention because, at the time, he was still dealing with the divorce case from his first wife Linda Claridge, to whom he was married for around 26 years, from which they had two children. The divorce ended with Claridge getting a portion of his wealth, and equal custody of their children. Jennifer and Hogan continued to date for two years before he proposed to her, leading to the two holding a private intimate ceremony at Clearwater, Florida in the backyard of his house. The wedding was attended by close friends and family, including his two children. The wedding even had a bit of a scene, as one of the guards in the area fought with a paparazzi who was trying to get in to hopefully get a snapshot of the wedding.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=life-since-marriage></span>Life Since Marriage<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One of the other things that attracted controversy between McDaniel’s relationship with Hogan is their age gap. She is 20 years younger than her husband, and with her background, many believed that she was only dating him for the money, and wasn’t interested in the retired wrestler. This turned out to be wrong as the two have remained together without much of an issue in their marriage. She even has a tattoo of his name Terry on her right wrist. They are both fitness enthusiasts, and often spend their time in the gym together.</p><p>Just two years into their marriage, issues struck once more as Hogan became involved in a sex scandal with Heather Clem, the wife of his friend. The sex tape which was released by the media outlet Gawker, led to a lengthy lawsuit that saw the company go bankrupt. She also stayed with him following the recording of Hogan going on a racially insensitive outburst, released online. The tape caused Hogan to lie low for a long time, before he later apologized for his actions.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=husband-%e2%80%93-hulk-hogan></span>Husband – Hulk Hogan<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hulk is of very mixed Italian, Scottish, Panamanian and French descent.</p><p>He was born in Augusta, Georgia, and his family later settled in Port Tampa, Florida. At a young age he aspired to be a professional baseball player, until an injury ended his hopes in that direction. Growing up, he followed the world of professional wrestling, and idolized names such as Dusty Rhodes and Superstar Billy Graham.</p><p>He didn’t initially intend on becoming a wrestler, first working as a musician, playing bass guitar for various rock bands based in Florida. He was a student at the University of South Florida, though he dropped out to fully pursue a music career. He gained a bit of popularity in Tampa Bay for his work with the band called Ruckus, and it was during his time there that he met professional wrestlers Jack and Gerald Brisco. The two later invited him to train, as he possessed the physique to make it in the industry.</p><p>In 1976, he tried out for professional wrestling, as he was already interested in it, and eventually quit his music job to train full-time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-success-of-hulk-hogan></span>The Success of Hulk Hogan<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Hogan began wrestling in the 1970s, he didn’t gain a lot of attention until the 1980s when he signed with World Wrestling Federation (WWF) which would later become World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). He joined the company during the professional wrestling boom of the 1980s, and his all-American persona became a hit with many viewers. He headlined the first nine WrestleManias of the company, and won the championship five times, initially holding the record for the longest championship reign in the company, eventually surpassed.</p><p>In the 1990s, he signed with WWF rival World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and continued to set records. He turned into his villainous Hollywood Hulk Hogan persona there, as a part of the New World Order (NWO), and was a big factor in the rating war between WCW and WWF during this time. Eventually, he completed his career in WWE, and was inducted as a Hall of Famer in 2005. Following his retirement, he’s been more focused on his career as a television personality and actor. He’s appeared in various commercials, and starred in several movies, including “Hogan Knows Best” and “Mr. Nanny”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Not a lot of details are known about Jennifer’s past before she met Hogan, though Hogan had a more public life. He was formerly married to Linda Claridge who would become a television personality thanks to the reality show “Hogan Knows Best”, which involved his family at the time. He allegedly had numerous affairs during the marriage, which later came to surface, leading to the duo’s divorce. He lost around 70% of their assets following the divorce, and even contemplated suicide. He met McDaniel in 2008, and they were engaged a year later leading to their marriage. The two share the Christian faith.</p><h2 class=tabtitle><span class=ez-toc-section id=general-info></span>General Info<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tr><td>Full
