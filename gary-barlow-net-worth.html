He is also known as a judge in the TV show “The X Factor UK”. His career has been active since 1986.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Gary Barlow is, as of late 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Gary’s net worth is over $90 million, an amount which has been accumulated through his successful career in the entertainment industry. Another source of his wealth is coming from the sale of his autobiographical book “My Take” (2006).</p><h3>Gary Barlow Net Worth $90 Million</h3><p>Gary Barlow was raised with his older brother by his father, Colin Barlow, and his mother, Marjorie Barlow. At the age of 10, his parents bought him a keyboard, and soon he began to play his favorite songs. He attended Weaver Vale Primary School, after which he enrolled at Frodsham High School.</p><p>Gary’s musical career began when he was 15 years old, reaching the semi-finals in the BBC show “Pebble Mill At One” with the song “Let’s Pray For Christmas”. He was spotted by casting agent Niger Martin-Smith, who selected him to be the lead vocalist and songwriter in a boy band called Take That, together with <a href=#>Robbie Williams</a>, <a href=#>Jason Orange</a>, <a href=#>Howard Donald</a> and <a href=#>Mark Owen</a>. Since then, his career has only gone upwards, as well as his net worth.</p><p>The band signed to RCA Records, and its debut studio album “Take That & Party” came out in 1992, peaking at No. 2 on the UK charts. They became well-known through having a number of Top 40 hits, including such singles as “Could It Be Magic”, “Pray” and “Only Takes A Minute”, among others. In the following year was released their second album – “Everything Changes”, which was mostly based on Gary’s material and reached No. 1 on the UK charts, increasing his net worth by a large margin.</p><p>Soon after, they published their third album entitled “Nobody Else”, launching three No. 1 singles including “Back For Good”, which reached No. 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was followed by the single “How Deep Is Your Love”, which became one of its best songs ever reaching No. 1 on several charts. However, the band split up in 1996, and didn’t reform, without <a href=#>Robbie Williams</a>, until 2005, after the documentary film “Take That: For The Record”. Hence, they released four albums, including “Beautiful World” (2006), “Progress” (2010), “III” (2014), all of which achieved platinum status.</p><p>In 1996, Gary began to pursue further his career in the music industry as a solo artist, in that year releasing two No. 1 singles in the UK – “Love Won’t Wait” and “Forever Love”, which added a considerable amount to his net worth. His debut solo studio album entitled “Open Road” was released in the same year, and sold two million copies all over the world. Further, he has now released three more albums – “Twelve Months, Eleven Days” (1999), “Sing” (2012), and “Since I Saw You Last” (2013).</p><p>Additionally, Gary has also written a number of songs for such musicians as <a href=#>Will Young</a>, <a href=#>Charlotte Church</a>, Westlife, etc. Besides that, in 2011 he began to appear in the TV show “The X Factor UK”, alongside <a href=#>Kelly Rowland</a>, <a href=#>Tulisa Contostavlos</a>, and <a href=#>Louis Walsh</a>. All of these have had a huge influence on his net worth.</p><p>Thanks to his accomplishments in the music industry, Gary has won a number of awards and recognitions, the most important was the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2012. He has also been the winner of Ivor Novello Award seven times.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Gary Barlow has been married to Dawn Andrews since 2000; the couple has three children together, and their residence is in London, England. In spare time, he is very active in charity work.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=33.63688840022><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Gary Barlow</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$90 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 20, 1971</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Frodsham, Cheshire, England, UK</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 9" (1.75 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, songwriter, record producer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Dawn Andrews (m. 2000)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Daniel Barlow, Poppy Barlow, Emily Barlow, Daisy Barlow</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Marge Barlow, Colin Barlow</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Ian Barlow</td></tr><tr readability=0.31372549019608><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/OfficialGaryBarlow</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/garybarlow</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://plus.google.com/+GaryBarlow</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/officialgarybarlow/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.41176470588235><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://myspace.com/gbarlow</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0055239/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25396825396825><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gary-barlow-mn0000740360</a></td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Awards</td><td>National Television Award for Outstanding Contribution, Virgin Media Awards, Billboard International Hit of the Year, Q Award for Best Collaboration, Ivor Novello Award, Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to Music and to Charity, Music Industry Trusts Award (2012)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Record Labels</td><td>Sony, Polydor, Universal, Decca, Future, San Remo</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>Albums</td><td>“Open Road" (1997)”, “Twelve Months, Eleven Days” (1999), “Sing” (2012), “Since I Saw You Last” (2013), “Twelve Months, Eleven Days Album by Gary Barlow” (1999), “Take That & Party” (1992), “Beautiful World” (2006), “Wonderland” (2017)</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Take That</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nominations</td><td>Brit Awards - Best British Group/Best British Album/Best British Single/Best British Live Act, 2012 Queen's Birthday Honours, Virgin Media Awards, The London Awards for Best Album</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Movies</td><td>Take That: For the Record (2005), Take That: Never Forget: The Ultimate Collection (2006), Take That: Beautiful World Live (2008), Take That: From Zeroes to Heroes: The Early Years (2007)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>TV Shows</td><td>The X Factor (UK) Interactive (Since 2004), New Year Live, Last Choir Standing (2008), BBC Pebble Mill at One (1986)</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=20.487199180748><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=3.48><td>1</td><td>When <a href=#>One Direction</a> announced their album was called "Four", I thought "Yes, they've lost a member!"</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>Anybody who follows me on Twitter knows that I'm constantly posting pictures of new keyboards I've bought.</td></tr><tr readability=15.284210526316><td>3</td><td><a href=#>Tony Hadley</a>, I think one of my top five favourite singers of all time.
