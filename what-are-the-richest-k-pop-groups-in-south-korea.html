The seven-member boy group debuted under Big Hit Entertainment in 2013 and initially achieved only moderate success. Now, you’d be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn’t heard of the group after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their successful singles</a>, world tours, and marketing campaigns. They have worked with brands such as Baskin-Robbins, LeSportsac, Sketchers, Mattel, Casetify, Tamagotchi, VT Cosmetics, Jamie Wander, McDonald’s, Baskin Robbins, and Casetify over their career. As of 2022, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the group’s net worth</a> is thought to be anywhere from $100 million to $150 million.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>In 2018, the Hyundai Research Institute reported that BTS generates $3.5 billion worth of economic value to South Korea each year. This number is reportedly increasing by $1.2 billion every year. In addition, they have also been credited with being one of the main reasons for the growth in music sales worldwide in 2018, amounting to a total of $19 billion in sales.</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>According to Celebrity Net Worth, the BTS boys made US$170 million in 2019 from their Love Yourself World Tour, more than any other American band except Metallica.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>Many K-pop groups live together in dorms, but BTS secured one of South Korea’s most expensive at Hannam the Hill thanks to its multimillion-dollar fortune. Per Allkpop, this complex houses other celebrities, such as Psy and actress Han Hyo-joo, as well as some high-rolling businessmen.

If reports are to be believed, the group is worth an insane $1 billion. EXO debuted in 2012 with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“MAMA”</a>&nbsp;with both Korean and Chinese versions and were the most popular boy group in South Korea for years after their debut, so it’s understandable that they’d be high-earners. It’s possible the high net worth could be inflated as a few media outlets think the number is closer to $100 million but the majority of media outlets report that EXO is a billion-dollar boy group. For example, Popnable examined the band’s earnings from the past seven years and found that they earned an average of US$2.5 million from 2016 to 2022.</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>They are also involved in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a variety of activities</a> and projects, such as acting and solo music releases, in addition to their idol duties. “Don’t Mess Up My Tempo,” EXO’s best-selling album, sold more than 1.9 million copies. They’ve held many world tours and contributed greatly to SM Entertainment’s financial success. According to reports, SM made $188 million during the 4th quarter of 2018, with EXO contributing 31%.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>Because of the group’s widespread influence, Forbes’ Korea Power Celebrity listed Exo among the top five most influential Korean celebrities from 2014 to 2018.
