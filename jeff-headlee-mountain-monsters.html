Not only is Jeff well-versed in the mountain terrain, but he is also well-versed in mountain folklore as well as textbook history. One of the founding members of the Appalachian Investigators of Mysterious Sightings, Jeff met <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Tice</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Willy McQuillian</a> during his early years, and the trio set off on a unique search for the paranormal. A part of the reality TV series Mountain Monsters, Jeff has been a regular cast member since the first season. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Jeff Headlee.</p><h2>Who is Jeff Headlee?</h2><p>Jeff Headlee is an American reality television personality, researcher, and founder of AIMS. He co-founded AIM&nbsp;alongside <a href=#>Willy McQuillian</a> and&nbsp; <a href=#>Joh Trapper Tice</a>, the latter of who passed away on December 16, 2019. Jeff is Sagittarius born and comes from a Caucasian household. And according to astrological readings, males born under his zodiac sign are said to possess the traits of being outgoing and cheerful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Mountain-Monsters-cast-Jeff-Headlee.jpg><h2>Early Life:</h2><p>Jeff Headlee was born on December 21, 1957, in Vienna, West Virginia, United States. He is the son of <span>Mildred Headlee who celebrated her 90th birthday on February 6, 2022. </span>Jeff grew up in his hometown where he began his schooling too. He attended Parkersburg High School and later enrolled at&nbsp;&nbsp;West Virginia University at Parkersburg.</p><h2>Personal Vendetta:</h2><p>For the longest time, Jeff led a normal life. Born and raised in Virginia, things were working out for Jeff and the man was breezing through life. Things changed for Jeff when an unidentified animal attacked Jeff’s dog. After the accident, Jeff searched for animal records trying to identify the animal that struck the blow. But to Jeff’s dismay, the search ended without any results. Since then, Jeff abandoned the regular search and started looking at mythical creatures. During this time, he met with Trapper, and Willy and the trio shared their experiences. Even though each one of them had a separate goal in mind, their objectives aligned. Over the years, the trio established the Appalachian Investigators of Mysterious Sightings and began searching for the supernatural.</p><h2>Researcher of the group:</h2><p>One of the unique features of the AIMS group is that their jobs are well-assigned. Each member of the team has a specialty and does related work. Of the original three, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John</a> was an expert trapper and also doubled down as the team leader. On the other hand, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Willy</a> also worked as a trapper but often put a creative spin on his traps. Unlike the previous two, Jeff had no prior experience in hunting and worked as the team’s resident researcher and technology expert. During the team’s nightly hunts, Jeff is left in charge of the thermal camera. Quick on his mind, Jeff often lines up witnesses for the team’s investigations. Even though Jeff receives less screen time than his co-workers, he works tirelessly behind the scenes to analyze the information on hand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Mountain-Monsters-cast.jpg><h2>Trouble along the way:</h2><p>With no prior experience, Jeff had trouble during the first few seasons of the show. He simply recorded too many sightings. This made it difficult for the group to analyze the information on hand. As most hunts are carried out during the night, Jeff could not effectively figure out what he was seeing. But over the years, he grew familiar with the technology and learned from his mistakes.</p><h2>Mountain Monsters:</h2><p>Jeff Headlee is a cast member of the reality television show “Mountain Monster.”&nbsp; The show follows a team of hunters and trappers from West Virginia, known as the “AIMS team,” as they search for and investigate alleged sightings of mysterious creatures in the Appalachian Mountains. The team uses a variety of techniques, including tracking and trapping, to try to capture or gather evidence of these creatures. They also often interview local residents who claim to have seen the creatures.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeff made his show debut in 2013 on season 1, episode 1 titled “Wolfman of Wolfe County.” He then regularly appeared making 80 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appearances</a> until season 8 in 2022. Jeff did not win any awards or nominations for his involvement in the reality television world.</p><p>When not hunting for bigfoot and monster-like creatures, Jeff Headlee is involved in business endeavors of his own. He is the owner and operator of the Antique shop “<span class=rse6dlih>H&S Trading Post” in Waterford, Ohio.</span></p><h2>Net Worth:</h2><p>Jeff brings in a considerable sum of money from Mountain Monsters. He also makes money through other endeavors. As of now, he has a net worth of&nbsp; $500,000.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><h2>Wife & Children:</h2><p>Reality television star Jeff Headlee is a married man. He is married to his longtime wife Tammy Diane Snyder. Tammy is a native of West Virginia who attended Rowlesburg High School. Jeff and Tammy exchanged their wedding vows on July 21, 1990. The pair moved to Waterford, Ohio, after marriage and currently resides there. The pair are going strong in their marriage after over 32 years. <span>On the occasion of their&nbsp; 29th anniversary, through a Facebook post, Tammy gave an insight into their long marriage and how they have been able to do it. She </span><span>was frank about the rough times but together they dealt with it.</span></p><p>In the years of togetherness as a married couple, they have given birth to two children Cody Brian Headlee followed by Alex Headlee. Alex is passionate about cars and went to Waterford High School.&nbsp;</p><h2>Grandchildren:</h2><p>Headlee family further extends with Grandchildren with both of their children Cody and Alex contributing. Alex and his partner <span class=rse6dlih>Sierra Gaskins welcomed their first child, Braxton Headlee in 2020. </span>Cody and his partner <span class=rse6dlih>Danielle Nycole also have given birth to offspring.</span></p><h2>Body Features:</h2><p>Jeff has a&nbsp; big build and below-average American height which is 5 feet 9 inches for men. Jeff has blue eyes and likes to keep a long bushy beard and has white hair.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=5.8649155722326><tr><td>Name</td><td>Jeff Headlee</td></tr><tr><td>Nickname</td><td>Jeffro</td></tr><tr><td>Birthdate</td><td>December 21, 1957</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Birthplace</td><td>Vienna, West Virginia, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>65 years old</td></tr><tr><td>Resident</td><td>Waterford, Ohio, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>Caucasian</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Mildred Headlee</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>High School</td><td>Parkersburg High School</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Career</td><td>Television personality, AIMS Researcher & Founder</td></tr><tr><td>Net worth</td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Relationship Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Wife</td><td>Tammy Diane Headlee (m.1990-present)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Cody Brian Headlee, Alex Headlee</td></tr><tr><td>Grandchildren</td><td>Braxton Headlee</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>Below 5 feet 9 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td>Social media</td><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Headlee</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGihnp6WYrWmrcOlnJ5lnaTCr8DAoqVmpZ%2BjwLWx0axm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeff-headlee-mountain-monsters.html&text=age%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20wife%2c%20kids.&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeff-headlee-mountain-monsters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeff-headlee-mountain-monsters.html&title=age%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20wife%2c%20kids." target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeff-headlee-mountain-monsters.html&title=age%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20wife%2c%20kids." target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeff-headlee-mountain-monsters.html&title=age%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20wife%2c%20kids." target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeff-headlee-mountain-monsters.html&description=age%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20wife%2c%20kids." target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gordon-lightfoot.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gordon Lightfoot">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./176848-meet-private-practice-cast-12-years-afte-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Private Practice:' Meet the Cast 12 Years after 1st Episode of the Medical Drama Aired">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
