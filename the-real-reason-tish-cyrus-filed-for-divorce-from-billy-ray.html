In 1992, Tish got pregnant with their first child, Miley. But at the time, Billy Ray was already expecting a child with Kristin Luckey. The latter gave birth to a baby boy named Christopher in April that year. Miley arrived in November. The Achy Breaky Heart singer had to pick which of the women he would marry. He eventually chose Tish. They tied the knot in their living room in Franklin, Tennessee in 1993.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billy Ray's record label advised against the wedding due to his popularity with female fans."This train may come off the tracks, but I'm going to be a dad," the musician said of his decision to marry Tish during an interview with ABC in 2004. "I'm going to be a husband, and try to have something in my life that is right." He also adopted her children from her first marriage: Brandi and Trace Cyrus. In 1994, the couple welcomed their second child together, a son named Braison. <a href=#>Their youngest child, Noah Cyrus</a> arrived later in 2000.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Miley Cyrus Have The Highest Net Worth Of All Disney Channel Stars?</a></span></p><h2 id=inside-tish-amp-billy-ray-cyrus-39-30-year-marriage>Inside Tish & Billy Ray Cyrus' 30-Year Marriage</h2><p>The couple seemed to be doing well at first. But in October 2010, Billy Ray filed for divorce for the first time, citing "irreconcilable differences." A month later, it was reported that Tish had an affair with Bret Michaels which he later denied. "I've been friends with her family forever," Michaels said. "It started out with me and Miley simply working on a song together. Her mom, Tish, likes Every Rose Has Its Thorn, the first concert Miley ever saw was Poison, and so they wanted to remake it for the new record."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At one point amid the divorce, <a href=#>Billy Ray blamed Hannah Montana for "destroying" his family</a>. "Hannah Montana probably has brought a lot of families together—just not one…" he said in an explosive GQ interview. "I hate to say it, but yes, I do. Yeah. I'd take it back in a second. For my family to be here and just be everybody okay, safe and sound and happy and normal, would have been fantastic. Heck, yeah. I'd erase it all in a second if I could." In February 2011, the actor retracted his statements agains the Disney show. He also revealed that he was "mending" his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It is very important to me to work on mending my family right now," he said, adding that his comments in GQ were "explosive, and unintentionally so." He continued: "My family is the most important thing I have, and we are working together to make sure our future is stronger and healthier." Three months later, he called off the divorce. "I've dropped the divorce," he told The View at the time. "I want to put my family back together. Things are the best they've ever been. I feel like I got my Miley back in a way. I feel like we are the daddy and daughter that we were before Hannah Montana happened."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The True Story Behind Why Miley Cyrus Changed Her Name</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-tish-amp-billy-ray-cyrus-are-getting-divorced-for-the-third-time>Why Tish & Billy Ray Cyrus Are Getting Divorced For The Third Time</h2><p>In 2013, Tish filed for divorce. "This is a personal matter and we are working to find a resolution that is in the best interest of our family. We ask that you respect our privacy at this time," she told People at the time. The two reconciled a month later."We both woke up and realized we love each other and decided we want to stay together," they said in a joint statement. "We both went into couples therapy something we haven't done in 22 years of being together, and it's brought us closer together and really opened up our communication in amazing ways."</p><p>However, it seems like they just couldn't make it work as Tish filed to end their marriage again on April 6, 2022 due to irreconcilable differences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It is after 30 years, five amazing children and a lifetime of memories, we have decided to go our separate ways — not with sadness, but with love in our hearts," the couple said in a statement. "We have grown up together, raised a family we can be so proud of, and it is now time to create our own paths. We will always be family and look forward to a continued and loving shared experience as friends and parents. We have not come to this decision lightly or quickly but with so much going on in the world, we wanted to provide some clarity and closure, so we can remain focused on what is important. With Love and Hope… Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Maxx Morando And Miley Cyrus: The Truth About Their Private Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7KiuIyrnJqrn6N6tbXSoWScsaKqwG6yyKWcnWWWpL9usMivpqublWKzs7vMZpmipJyuerOt2Gg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-real-reason-tish-cyrus-filed-for-divorce-from-billy-ray.html&text=The%20Real%20Reason%20Tish%20Cyrus%20Filed%20For%20Divorce%20From%20Billy%20Ray&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-real-reason-tish-cyrus-filed-for-divorce-from-billy-ray.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-real-reason-tish-cyrus-filed-for-divorce-from-billy-ray.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Tish%20Cyrus%20Filed%20For%20Divorce%20From%20Billy%20Ray" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-real-reason-tish-cyrus-filed-for-divorce-from-billy-ray.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Tish%20Cyrus%20Filed%20For%20Divorce%20From%20Billy%20Ray" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-real-reason-tish-cyrus-filed-for-divorce-from-billy-ray.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Tish%20Cyrus%20Filed%20For%20Divorce%20From%20Billy%20Ray" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-real-reason-tish-cyrus-filed-for-divorce-from-billy-ray.html&description=The%20Real%20Reason%20Tish%20Cyrus%20Filed%20For%20Divorce%20From%20Billy%20Ray" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./samsung-ativ-q-hands-on-3200-x-1800-133-tablet-running-windows-8-and-android.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="3200 x 1800 13.3&amp;quot; Tablet Running Windows 8 and Android">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./once-a-legend-always-a-legend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Once a Legend, Always a Legend">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
