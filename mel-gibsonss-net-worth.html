In any case, this is a very stylish ride.</p><h4>Mercedes-Benz ML320</h4><p>The Mercedes-Benz ML320 was once the hottest new SUV on the market, thanks to its European-inspired style and powerful engine options made it a flexible compact SUV.</p><p>The Mercedes-Benz ML320 offered customers a more modern SUV at a lower price than the G-Class SUV.</p><p>There were additional features in the ML320 that you wouldn’t expect, such as an available third-row seat, which provided for a comfortable ride home from the soccer field when you had extra passengers.</p><h4>2005 Lexus LS 400</h4><p>Mel Gibson had previously owned a 2005 Lexus LS 400 in addition to his 2006 model, demonstrating his continued caution when it came to large-ticket vehicle purchases.</p><p>The only variation between the two automobiles was the exterior color; other than adding an AUX port for audio playback, there were no significant alterations between the two model years.</p><p>The 2005 Lexus LS 400 is a fantastic car that builds on Lexus’s reputation for build quality and dependability over the last few decades.</p><h4>Mercedes-Benz 500E</h4><p>The Mercedes-Benz 500E is about as unusual as they get when it comes to a remarkable vehicle that is both fast and entertaining to drive.</p><p>According to Motor Trend, only 500 vehicles were produced per year from 1991 to 1995, making this one of the most sought-after Mercedes-Benz cars on American soil.</p><p>The lightweight and stylish car package may lead you to believe that this is just another sedan, but a look under the hood at the strong 32-Valve V8 engine will convince you otherwise.</p><h4>1981-1982 Chevrolet C30 Silverado</h4><p>Mel Gibson was a heartthrob in the 1980s, and part of his attraction was his rough, no-nonsense attitude, which set him apart.</p><p>The 1981-1982 Chevrolet C30 Silverado was Mel Gibson’s vehicle of choice in the original “Lethal Weapon” film, making it a very distinctive standout on a police movie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mel-gibsons-car.jpg><p>Mel Gibson also owned a 1981-1982 Chevrolet C30 Silverado, recognized for its tough design and powerful engine options that provide the truck with a lot of carrying power.</p><h4>2011 Smart For-Two</h4><p>Mel Gibson is known for starring in some of the most well-known films of all time, which has resulted in a devoted following that numbers in the millions.</p><p>Mel Gibson is very modest about his automobile collection, as seen by his recent sighting in L.A. driving his 2011 Smart For-Two.</p><p>This automobile is not only ecologically friendly but also very reasonable; it is not, however, a car that one of the most famous movie stars of all time would acquire.</p><h4>2019 Acura TLX</h4><p>Given Mel Gibson’s fondness for his enormous luxury car, the LS400, it’s only fair that we look at a comparable Japanese sedan for the actor.</p><p>The 2019 Acura TLX would be an ideal vehicle for the well-known actor, as it incorporates some of Acura’s most notable features into one of the company’s most advanced sedans yet.</p><p>The 2019 Acura TLX is not a half-measure, and the sedan is poised to be one of Acura’s most notable releases in quite some time. We believe Mel Gibson would adore this fast sedan, and it may even delight him more than the LS400 in the long run.</p><h4>&nbsp;2019 Volvo XC90</h4><p>Mel Gibson adores his family, and he is still a father to two young children. As a result, safety is still a priority in the Gibson household, and choosing a safe car for the entire family can be difficult.</p><p>The 2019 Volvo XC90 builds on the brand’s unique safety reputation while also improving the basic formula that has made the XC90 a terrific SUV for the previous decade.</p><p>Mel would enjoy the 2019 Volvo XC90, which comes with some of the most advanced safety systems ever seen on an SUV.</p><h4>2019 Kia Stinger</h4><p>No, you aren’t misreading the title. There’s a reason why we’ve included a Kia in this list. Mel Gibson is a frugal man, so we believe he would enjoy getting his money’s worth out of the fantastic 2019 Kia Stinger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mel-gibsons-kia.jpg><p>Kia used to be a somewhat unknown automaker, offering the tiny Sportage and Sephia to just about anyone who happened upon a Kia dealership.</p><h3>Private Jet</h3><p>Mel Gibson hasn’t been seen in a long time. He has since appeared in a few films, although none of them have been successful. To stay relevant and generate more money, he needs a hit movie right now.</p><p>According to reports, Gibson spends $7.2 million per year on living expenditures, which does not include the upkeep of his beloved Gulfstream V.</p><p>Nonetheless, Gibson has one of the world’s safest and longest-range jets, costing $40 million. Gibson travels the world with his private jet.</p><p>Even at 51,000 feet, the Gulfstream V private aircraft can reach any place in the world in record time and provide unrivaled comfort.</p><h3>Private Island</h3><p>Gibson was one of the most famous people in the world in 2005 because of the success of his film The Passion of the Christ. He decided to put some of his money to work by putting down some substantial cash.</p><p>Gibson bought the island of Mago, one of the world’s largest private islands, in that year.</p><p>Gibson is said to have paid $15 million for the island, which has 5,400 acres of breathtaking volcanic beauty, featuring “powder-white beaches and turquoise lagoons.”</p><p>Although it is unclear how much time Gibson spends on the island these days, it appears that he still owns the island in the South Pacific. The actor may decide to offer it up for tours or visits at some point in the future, but for now, it is only for private use.</p><p><strong>You might also be interested in <a href=# rel=noopener>Lele Pons’s Net Worth: Book & Career</a></strong></p><h2>Mel Gibson: Lifestyle</h2><p>Mel Gibson’s annual living expenses are $7.2 million.</p><p>Gibson’s lawyers referenced the amount of $600,000 each month in court last week, according to RadarOnline.com, “as part of their argument to limit Oksana (Grigorievachild )’s support for their infant daughter, Lucia, to $6,000 per month.”</p><p>The figure does not include luxuries like his private jet, according to the lawyers.</p><p>Grigorieva asked a judge to enhance Gibson’s child support payments for their nine-month-old son. “While Oksana feels she is entitled to more, Mel insists that some of her expenses, such as bodyguards, are unnecessary,” according to RadarOnline.</p><p>Moreover, Mel Gibson had a million-dollar art collection, but he and his ex-wife Robyn Moore sold it at Christie’s auction house a few years ago.</p><p>The couple was forced to accept a $2 million loss on their iconic Maxfield Parrish Daybreak, sold at auction. This painting was purchased for $ 7.6 million at an auction by the actor’s ex-wife a few years ago.</p><p>Gibson also sold his favorite picture, Sing a Song of Sixpence, for a pittance, which used to display in the couple’s Connecticut estate. To settle the divorce agreement, the couple had to sell their collection.</p><h2>Mel Gibson: Movies, Director and Producer, Investment,</h2><h3>Movies</h3><p>Gibson’s first major appearances were in the Mad Max franchise, which he began working on shortly after graduating from college in 1977.

He also paid $15 million to Tokyu Corporation of Japan for Mago Island in Fiji in December 2004.</p><p>The purchase has been met with opposition by descendants of Mago’s original native inhabitants, who were ousted in the 1860s.

He wants this hypothetical film, like The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto, to have dialogue in period languages.</p><p>DiCaprio, on the other hand, declined to participate in the project. Gibson stated in a 2012 interview that the project, which he has dubbed Berserker, was still in the works.</p><p>In 2011, it was revealed that Gibson had commissioned a script on the Maccabees from Joe Eszterhas. Warner Brothers Pictures will release the picture. The announcement sparked a firestorm of debate.</p><p>Eszterhas wrote Gibson a letter in April 2012 accusing him of ruining their Maccabees project because he “hates Jews,” citing a series of private encounters in which he allegedly overheard Gibson express severely racist views.</p><p>Despite the fact that it was intended as a private letter, it was later released on a film industry website. In response, Gibson claimed that he still plans to create the picture but that it will not be based on Eszterhas’ script, which he deemed inadequate.</p><p>Eszterhas subsequently claimed that his son secretly taped many of Gibson’s purported “hateful rants.” Gibson revealed in a 2012 interview that the Maccabees film was still in the works.</p><h2>Mel Gibson: Controversy and Legal Issues</h2><p>In an attempt to keep Gibson away from their child, Oksana Grigorieva filed a restraining order against him in 2010.

The Hollywood community didn’t warm up to him again until he published Hacksaw Ridge.</p><p>Gibson has spoken openly about his alcoholism and rehabilitation in numerous interviews. He was prohibited from driving in Canada for three months after rear-ending a car in Toronto while inebriated in 1984.</p><p>On July 28, 2006, he was detained for a DUI after speeding in his automobile with an open container of alcohol.
