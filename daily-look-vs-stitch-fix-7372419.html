Both companies provide personal styling services by helping you refresh or add to your wardrobe with clothing delivered straight to your doorstep. Ultimately, the goal is to take the stress out of shopping and leave it to the professionals to select clothes that fit your style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dailylook and Stitch Fix have become popular choices for their access to a wide assortment of brands and the ability to cater to various styles. While there are quite a few similarities between the two — most notably that you only pay for what you keep&nbsp;— they also differ in key aspects,&nbsp; such as price, size ranges, and the number of items per shipment. To help you better understand these two services, we’ve compared both companies and also looked at a few additional options to help you decide which one works best for you.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-does-dailylook-work></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Does Dailylook Work?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Dailylook</a> offers clothing subscription boxes that have been tailored to your personal style. The company’s thorough style questionnaire covers the usual topics like sizing and preferences, but in a more comprehensive manner by diving into details like prints, materials, and colors you’d like to avoid. You’ll also send links to your social media, so your dedicated stylist can review and better understand your fashion sense. You’ll receive an email newsletter that highlights current fashion trends, which you can also send over to your stylist for additional inspiration. All of these factors ultimately help your stylist make informed decisions when handpicking up to 12 garments to send to you monthly, every other month, or quarterly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With Dailylook, you’ll be able to preview the box before it’s shipped and provide feedback on the selections and swap any items out that don’t fit your style. Brands will often include a combination of familiar labels and up-and-coming designers. Then, once you’ve tried on the garments at home, you’ll choose which pieces you’d like to keep, pay for only the selected items, and return the rest free of charge. The styling fee is credited to your account and can be used to purchase items in your box. And if you decide to buy at least three of five garments in the box, you’ll receive a discount on the lowest-priced piece.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-does-stitch-fix-work></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Does Stitch Fix Work?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="subid1=${DOC_ID}&subid2=${REQUEST_ID}">Stitch Fix</a> is another popular online styling service where you only pay for what you keep. The process begins with a fairly extensive style quiz that covers sizing, personal style, fit preferences, and budget. From there, a dedicated stylist is assigned to your account, who will then select items based on the information provided in your survey. The company offers styling services for women, men, and kids, and has a relatively low styling fee that is applied as a credit to the items you purchase. For women and men, five garments are included in each shipment, while kids’ boxes include 10 items. If you love everything in your box, you can keep all the items and receive a discount on all the pieces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The company has become a popular choice due to its variety of clothing, drawing from more than 1,000 brands that cover everything from athletic wear to work-friendly attire. And unlike many other services, boxes will occasionally include shoes and accessories. Keep in mind that garments cost anywhere between $20 to $500, meaning that quality can greatly vary from piece to piece. When it comes to shipping, Stitch Fix has a flexible, commitment-free policy that allows for on-demand boxes. But if you prefer to set up automatic deliveries, they can be scheduled in intervals of every two to three weeks, monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly. And before the items are sent, you’ll have the ability to preview everything and provide feedback to your stylist if anything isn’t to your liking. In fact, the more you interact with your stylist, the better the selections become.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dailylook-vs-stitch-fix-key-specs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Dailylook vs. Stitch Fix: Key Specs</span></h2><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Dailylook</h3><ul><li><strong>Styling fee: </strong>$40</li><li><strong>Starting price: </strong>$60</li><li><strong>Free shipping? </strong>Yes</li><li><strong>Size range: </strong>XS–3X, 0–24</li><li><strong>Try-on period: </strong>5 days</li><li><strong>Delivery frequency: </strong>Monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly</li><li><strong>Items per shipment: </strong>7–12</li><li><strong>Level of customization: </strong>Only pay for what you keep</li></ul><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Stitch Fix</h3><ul><li><strong>Styling fee: </strong>$20</li><li><strong>Starting price: </strong>$20</li><li><strong>Free shipping? </strong>Yes</li><li><strong>Size range: </strong>XS–3X for women, including petite, plus, and maternity; XS–3XL for men, including big and tall; 2T–18 for kids</li><li><strong>Try-on period: </strong>3 days</li><li><strong>Delivery frequency: </strong>Every 2–3 weeks, monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, or as requested</li><li><strong>Items per shipment: </strong>5 for men and women, 10 for kids</li><li><strong>Level of customization: </strong>Only pay for what you keep</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-much-do-dailylook-and-stitch-fix-cost></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Much Do Dailylook and Stitch Fix Cost?</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Dailylook Plans & Pricing</span></h3><ul id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Buy three or more items</strong> and get 50 percent off the lowest-priced item — prices start at $60 per garment</li><li><strong>Buy five or more items</strong> and get 50 percent off two of the lowest-priced items — prices start at $60 per garment<br></li></ul><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Stitch Fix Plans & Pricing</span></h3><ul id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>For men and women</strong>, buy all five items and get 25 percent off the entire shipment — prices start at $20 per garment</li><li><strong>For kids</strong>, buy all 10 items and get 25 percent off the entire shipment — prices start at $10 per garment<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dailylook-reviews></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Dailylook Reviews</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With over 2,000 reviews between Trustpilot and Influenster, the majority of Dailylook’s customers are happy with its styling service. As expected, the convenience of trying on clothes in the comfort of their own home is one aspect that many enjoy. Some reviewers note that the service is on the pricier side but appreciate the quantity discount and believe that the higher quality of garments in comparison to other online styling services is worth the trade-off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While many customers report attentive stylists and well-curated boxes with trendy items, some have had less luck with their assigned stylist. However, those who chose to continue their subscription and work with a different Dailylook stylist found better success the second time around. Several reviewers also said that boxes improve over time, proving that stylists pay attention to feedback.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to dissatisfied customers, many feel that the five-day try-on period is not enough time to return unwanted items and report unwarranted credit card charges. They also cite difficulty with getting in touch with customer service and expeditious resolutions. Some reviewers have also reported delayed shipments.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dailylook</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-stitch-fix-reviews></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Stitch Fix Reviews</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In comparison to Dailylook, Stitch Fix reviews are more split. Like Dailylook, customers appreciate the ability to try on clothes at home. Those who have enjoyed their experience also note spot-on selections that stayed within their stipulated budget, great customer service, and easy returns. Some reviewers were even impressed by how well the selected garments fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, others were unhappy with the quality of clothing and the lack of attention from their stylist, reporting that emails would go unanswered, that garments didn’t fall within budget, or that items didn’t match their style profile. Many customers also feel that the clothes don’t match current fashion trends. Some reviewers have also said that their accounts were unexpectedly deactivated after reaching out to customer service with a complaint.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pros-and-cons></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pros and Cons</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Dailylook</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Preview of items before they’re shipped</li><li>Ability to skip a month or pause subscription for up to 12 months</li><li>Communicate with a dedicated stylist</li><li>Daily emails with the latest fashion trends</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Higher styling fee than other services</li><li>Does not include accessories</li></ul><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Stitch Fix</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Offers over 1,000 brands</li><li>Preview of items before they’re shipped</li><li>Flexible delivery frequency with no commitment</li><li>Occasionally includes shoes and accessories</li><li>Communicate with a dedicated stylist</li><li>Caters to women, men, and kids</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Discount only provided if all items are purchased</li><li>Options may not be as trendy as other subscription services</li><li>Short try-on period</li></ul><figure id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Stitch Fix</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-alternatives-to-dailylook-and-stitch-fix></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Alternatives to Dailylook and Stitch Fix</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Online styling services</a> are not a one-size-fits-all solution.

Looking for activewear, undergarments, or clothing subscriptions that include accessories? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow">Wantable</a> might be the better fit.
