An impressive list of actors just missed the cut, having received eight Academy Award nominations, <strong>including Marlon Brando, Jack Lemmon, Cate Blanchett, Geraldine Page, Dame Judy Dench, Peter O’Toole</strong>, and <strong>Glenn Close</strong>.

Pacino’s one win was for his lead role in <strong>Scent of a Woman</strong>, a drama about a young student named Charlie (Chris O’Donnell) tasked with taking care of retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Frank (Pacino) for a weekend. Pacino had to convincingly play a blind war veteran who had fallen into a deep, alcoholic depression. His performance was moving and worthy of the win. It has been more than three decades since he won, but Pacino’s last nomination was recent: it was in 2020 for his supporting role in <strong><a href=#>The Irishman</a></strong>. He ultimately lost to Brad Pitt for <strong><a href=#>Once upon a Time…in Hollywood</a></strong>, which became Pitt’s first Oscar in an acting category.</p><p>Pacino is considered one of the best actors of the 20th century, appearing in some of the most iconic movies, often in roles of authority or as a vicious criminal. The 83-year-old shows no signs of slowing down with several new projects in the works. This includes <strong>Billy Knight</strong>, a summer 2024 drama film about two young aspiring filmmakers who discover old artifacts about a man named Billy Knight, who Pacino plays.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paul-newman><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Paul Newman</span></h2><h3 id=9-nominations-1-win>9 Nominations (1 Win)</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Winning Movie Title</p></th><th scope=col><p>Year</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>The Color of Money</p></td><td><p>1986</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>One of the best, most handsome leading men through the ‘60s and ‘70s, <strong><a href=#>Paul Newman’s acting career</a> </strong>continued well into the early 2000s, right up to his death in 2008. Newman was nominated several times for movies like <strong>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, <a href=#>The Hustler</a></strong>, and <strong>Cool Hand Luke</strong>, but it wasn’t until 1987 that he finally won for his role in <strong>The Color of Money</strong>. In that Martin Scorsese sports drama, which served as a sequel to The Hustler, Newman starred as “Fast Eddie” Felson, a retired pool hustler who finds his way back into the game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Newman did, in fact, receive additional Academy Awards, including an Honorary Academy in 1986, the same year as his win, along with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1994. The latter was thanks to his extensive charitable work, including founding Newman’s Own food company, which donates all post-tax profits and royalties to charity, as well as the SeriousFun Children’s Network and the Safe Water Network.

With two wins under his belt today, Washington is also the first Black actor to win multiple competitive Academy Awards and is the first and only Black male to win in both the lead and supporting categories.</p><p>Washington’s first nomination came in 1988 for <strong>Cry Freedom</strong>, but it was his supporting role as Private Silas Trip in <strong>Glory</strong>, a historical war drama about the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War, that earned him a win. His second win came in 2002 for the movie <strong><a href=#>Training Day</a></strong> when Washington starred as a hardened, ruthless LAPD narcotics officer working in the gang-ridden neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles. Washington is known for fully immersing himself in every character, capturing every nuance of emotion and mannerism such that he almost becomes unrecognizable as himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spencer-tracy><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Spencer Tracy</span></h2><h3 id=9-nominations-2-wins>9 Nominations (2 Wins)</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Winning Movie Title</p></th><th scope=col><p>Year</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Captains Courageous</p></td><td><p>1937</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Boys Town</p></td><td><p>1938</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Though he passed away in 1967, <strong><a href=#>Spencer Tracy</a></strong> was an Old Hollywood star who earned back-to-back Academy Awards in the 1930s.

It’s about a spoiled, troubled young boy who ends up falling overboard a steamship and being rescued by a down-to-Earth Portuguese American fisherman (Tracy) who helps humble him. His second award came in 1938 for the biographical movie <strong>Boys Town</strong> about a priest working with underprivileged boys, inspired by the story of a condemned prisoner whose last words talked of his childhood hardships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tracy went on to receive seven more nominations through the ‘50s and ‘60s, right up to his final one for <strong>Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,</strong> the same day he passed away.

It wasn’t until several years later, in 1981 when De Niro was called the winner once again for his role in <strong><a href=#>Raging Bull</a></strong>, a biographical sports drama by Martin Scorsese about the boxing career and life of Jake LaMotta.</p><p>De Niro has been steadily acting since, often taking on both serious and comedic roles, always with his signature menacing look and often imitating facial expressions and mannerisms. He has received nominations in almost every decade, most recently for <strong><a href=#>The Irishman</a></strong> (he was nominated with the cast and crew for Best Picture). Working with frequent collaborator Scorsese, De Niro’s latest supporting role in Killers of the Flower Moon, an epic western crime drama about the murders of Osage members on their tribal land, proves that, at 80 years old, De Niro is still in the running to move up this list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=laurence-olivier><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Laurence Olivier</span></h2><h3 id=10-nominations-1-win>10 Nominations (1 Win)</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Winning Movie Title</p></th><th scope=col><p>Year</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Hamlet</p></td><td><p>1948</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>He passed away in 1989 and only ever won one Academy Award, despite being one of only five actors to ever receive 10 or more nominations. <strong><a href=#>Laurence Olivier’s</a></strong> single win was for<strong><a href=#> Hamlet</a></strong>, a British adaptation of the Shakespeare play in which he starred as the title character.

Through her career, she earned a total of 10 nominations and won twice, both in the 1930s. Her first win was for<strong> Dangerous,</strong> as a down-on-her-luck former Broadway actress who sweeps an architect of his feet. Three years later, she won again for <strong>Jezebel</strong>, a romantic drama in which she played a young woman living through the antebellum period, whose headstrong nature costs her love.</p><p>Davis went on to earn many more nominations, including four in a row for <strong>Dark Victory</strong> (1940), <strong>The Letter</strong>(1941), <strong>The Little Foxes</strong> (1942), and <strong>Now, Voyager</strong> (1943).

Streep has no movie projects in the works at this time but has confirmed she will be returning for season 4 of Only Murders in the Building.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Great Animated Movies That Charmed the Oscars</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kvLSvwKuqZpmTqbyzec2opKKmkam2sLrSaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2foscars-actor-nominations.html&text=10%20Actors%20With%20the%20Most%20Oscar%20Nominations&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2foscars-actor-nominations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2foscars-actor-nominations.html&title=10%20Actors%20With%20the%20Most%20Oscar%20Nominations" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2foscars-actor-nominations.html&title=10%20Actors%20With%20the%20Most%20Oscar%20Nominations" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2foscars-actor-nominations.html&title=10%20Actors%20With%20the%20Most%20Oscar%20Nominations" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2foscars-actor-nominations.html&description=10%20Actors%20With%20the%20Most%20Oscar%20Nominations" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./club-3ds-csv1562-usb-typec-dock-has-three-4k-display-outputs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Club 3Ds CSV-1562 USB Type-C Dock Has Three 4K Display Outputs">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-a-fofoti-tree-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is a Fofoti tree?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
