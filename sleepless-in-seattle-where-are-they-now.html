But behind the scenes her 10-year marriage to Quaid was falling apart. The actor, who fought substance abuse during his first marriage to actor PJ Soles, later admitted to being jealous of Meg’s success.</p><p>Meg, who went on to star in hits like When A Man Loves A Woman in 1994 and City of Angels in 1998, later denied Crowe was the reason for the split, alleging: “Dennis was not faithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful.”</p><p>She said the break-up had made her feel like a ‘scarlet woman’, and she lost her squeaky clean image as America’s sweetheart.</p><p>In 2003 she had an excruciating exchange with Michael Parkinson during an awkward interview about her poorly reviewed erotic thriller The Cut. Meg answered Parkinson’s questions with one-word answers and later told him to "wrap it up".</p><p>He insisted Meg was "rude and difficult" but in 2021 he admitted he <a href=#>could have handled the interview better.</a></p><p>Meg later said she felt "burnt out" by fame, adding: “I didn’t feel like I knew enough anymore about myself or the world to reflect it as an actor. I felt isolated.”</p><p>She went on to date rock star John Mellencamp on and off between 2011 and 2014, getting back together in 2017 when they got engaged.</p><p>But Mellencamp messed up their relationship saying: “I love Meg Ryan. She doesn’t love me so much. She’s&nbsp; a great girl. I’m just a s***** boyfriend’.”</p><p>These days Meg, 61, shuns the limelight and is dogged by plastic surgery rumours - something she refuses to confirm or deny.</p><h2>Ross Malinger&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rosstwiup.jpg><p>Ross was just eight when he starred as Tom Hanks' on-screen son Jonah Baldwin.</p><p>Another child actor named Nathan Watt originally got the part but Hanks became annoyed when he kept repeating dialogue off camera.</p><p>Ross, now 38, went on to star with Jean-Claude Van Damme in the 1995 film Sudden Death and Kirstie Alley two years later in Toothless.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He also had a small role in Seinfeld and did&nbsp;voiceover work for the animated kids series Recess.</p><p>But Ross decided not to pursue a showbiz career and took a degree in sales and distributing in 2002.</p><p>He went on to work as a senior executive at a financial institution before landing a job as a car salesman in Los Angeles.</p><p>The dealership shut in 2019 and it’s not known where Ross is now.</p><p>He married wife Kelsey in 2011 but she filed for divorce after eight years according to TMZ.</p><h2>Rita Wilson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/newspress-collage-22818060-1687866131963.jpg><p>Tom Hanks' wife was desperate to play Meg Ryan’s best pal Becky in the movie but landed the part of his sister Suzy instead.</p><p>Rita, 66, was pleased in the end and said playing Suzy was “one of the most fun, most wonderful acting experiences I’ve ever had”.</p><p>She married Tom after they met on the set of Bosom Buddies in 1981 and have one of the most successful marriages in showbiz.</p><p>After Sleepless In Seattle, she starred in her husband’s film That Thing You Do in 1996 before landing parts in Runaway Bride in 1999, Beautiful Ohio in 2006, It’s Complicated in 2009 and Dawn Patrol in 2014.</p><p>Rita took a step back when the couple’s sons arrived, saying: “I slowed down my work because I really wanted to be the mum that was there when they got home, drove the carpool and did all those things.”</p><p>She has also worked as a producer, making films such as <a href=#>My Big Fat Greek Wedding </a>in 2002 and <a href=#>Mamma Mia! </a>In 2008.</p><p>Tragedy struck in 2015 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy.</p><p>She said she was “blown away” by the care her husband gave her.</p><p>Rita most recently starred in her husband’s film A Man Called Otto in 2022 about an autistic, grumpy widower whose life is changed by his friendship with an immigrant family.</p><h2>Bill Pullman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pullmantwin.jpg><p>Bill once joked he always played “the guy who loses the girl” after his character Walter was dumped by Meg’s Annie.</p><p>His on-screen personas were also given the elbow in A League of Their Own in 1992 and three years later in While You Were Sleeping.</p><p>Bill, now 69, went on to make it big with Independence Day, Lake Placid and The Equalizer.</p><p>The down-to-earth actor suffered a head injury aged 21 when he fell while rehearsing a play and lost his sense of smell and all feeling in his left elbow.</p><p>He was 32 when he got his first big role in Ruthless People in 1986 alongside Danny DeVito and Bette Midler and called himself a “late bloomer”.</p><p>He said: “When strangers say ‘I really like you in…I have no idea whether they are going to say Capser or Spaceballs or The Sinner.
