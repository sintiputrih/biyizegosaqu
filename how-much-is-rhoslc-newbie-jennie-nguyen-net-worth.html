While she might be this season's newbie, it's certain that she isn't new to inserting herself into the drama. Jennie has been delivering some iconic lines, and when you throw her hilarious family into the mix, you've got yourself reality TV gold!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although this main focus this season is on none other than <a href=#>Jen Shah and her arrest</a>, it seems as if Jennie is getting down and dirty when it comes to Shah's ongoing feud with Meredith Marks. While Jennie was originally meant to be a "friend of" joining the gang along with Lisa Barlow, she was too good to not hold a snowflake!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'RHSOLC': Does Jen Shah Owe Meredith Marks' Family An Apology?</a></span></p><p>After sharing her story regarding her family's escape from Vietnam, fans have a lot of questions about her past, however, one question that remains is how rich is Jennie? Considering the Real Housewives are known for their lavish lifestyles, Nguyen and her family are certainly no exception. So, what is Jennie Nguyen's net worth? Let's dive in!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-jennie-nguyen-worth>How Much Is Jennie Nguyen Worth?</h2><p>Jennie Nguyen has been making us laugh since her debut on the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City. The star was originally meant to join the series in a "friend of" role, however, considering the mishaps that occurred with Jen Shah and her ongoing legal battle, it made the most sense to keep her on as a full-time addition, and boy are we happy Bravo did!</p><p>Nguyen, who reigns from Vietnam, has had quite an upbringing. After escaping her home country at 7-years-old, Jennie and her family were captured by Thai pirates, where they were held in Thailand for nearly 2 years. After being rescued by the Christian church, as Jennie described, they were flown to Long Beach, California, and have resided in the United States since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After her move to Salt Lake City, Jennie operated a number of medispas that she started from the ground up. Luckily for Jennie, her success as an entrepreneur allowed her to amass a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $3 million!</a> While Lisa Barlow and Mary Cosby are, in fact, the richest cast members, Jennie falls in second, making it clear that she's not to be toyed with.</p><p>Despite having millions to her name, Jennie instills her old-school values when it comes to her family. From cleaning up after themselves, doing chores, all the way to being exceptional in school, Jennie and her hubby, Duy, have done quite the stellar job at raising their three kids.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'RHOSLC': Did Meredith Marks Tip-Off The FBI In Jen Shah Arrest?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-sold-her-business-to-be-a-stay-at-home-mother>She Sold Her Business To Be A Stay-At-Home Mother</h2><p>Speaking of Jennie's children, the RHOSLC star revealed during her premiere episode that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she left behind her businesses</a> in order to be a stay-at-home mother full-time! While the decision wasn't an easy one to make, it became evident that Jennie would much rather be with her kids, than away at work.</p><p>Although this isn't something just anyone can do, as Jennie recognizes, it's clear that her decision certainly paid off. Jennie and her husband, Duy, share their three children, Atlas, Triton, and Karlyn. Since their debut, fans have been loving their kids, however, Karlyn certainly stands out as the fan-favorite, and rightfully so!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-jennie-39-s-husband-duy>Who Is Jennie's Husband, Duy?</h2><p>Jennie introduces fans to her husband, Duy Tran, who is a chiropractor. Although she described her hubby as a "butter face," claiming his body was amazing, but his face was not, it's apparent that the two share a special bond. Despite them being a close-knit unit, the two still have their differences.</p><p>Duy, who is adamant about expanding his family, doesn't seem to be getting a very warm welcome from viewers. After pressuring Jennie to have more kids, the RHOSLC star made it clear that she doesn't want to. Jennie went on to reveal that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has had 9 miscarriages</a>, and 3 c-sections, which explains her hesitancy towards having more children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's an ongoing issue that we've been having for many, many years. It has not been resolved," she shared. "It's an ongoing complication so there's no resolution yet, so you just have to watch and see if we have a solution for it or if we're still dealing with it right now," Jennie shared.</p><p>Duy has even gone as far as suggesting a sister-wife carry their child, which didn't sit well with Jennie. Fans are now upset with Dr. Duy for pressuring his wife to have more kids, despite knowing the dangers that come with it. Considering everything Jennie has been through with her fertility in the past, it's shocking that a doctor like Duy would continue to press the matter more and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why 'RHOSLC' Fans Want Jen Shah Fired</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyiqmaqmKTAra%2BMp5ywmpmaequxzaegnmWenMK6sc1mZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-is-rhoslc-newbie-jennie-nguyen-net-worth.html&text=How%20Much%20Is%20RHOSLC%20Newbie%2c%20Jennie%20Nguyen%20Worth%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-is-rhoslc-newbie-jennie-nguyen-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-is-rhoslc-newbie-jennie-nguyen-net-worth.html&title=How%20Much%20Is%20RHOSLC%20Newbie%2c%20Jennie%20Nguyen%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-is-rhoslc-newbie-jennie-nguyen-net-worth.html&title=How%20Much%20Is%20RHOSLC%20Newbie%2c%20Jennie%20Nguyen%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-is-rhoslc-newbie-jennie-nguyen-net-worth.html&title=How%20Much%20Is%20RHOSLC%20Newbie%2c%20Jennie%20Nguyen%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-is-rhoslc-newbie-jennie-nguyen-net-worth.html&description=How%20Much%20Is%20RHOSLC%20Newbie%2c%20Jennie%20Nguyen%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1412151-nxt-viewership-beats-aew-dynamite-by-a-wide-margin-on-10-10.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NXT Viewership Beats AEW Dynamite By A Wide Margin On 10/10">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./elisabeth-moss-net-worth-2022.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's How Elisabeth Moss Achieved Her Impressive $30 Million Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
