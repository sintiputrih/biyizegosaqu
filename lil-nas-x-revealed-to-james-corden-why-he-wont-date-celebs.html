He has ushered in a new wave of gay male representation in popular music.</p><p>He recently sat down with James Corden for his very own Carpool Karaoke segment. During the chat, Montero revealed he's met some "well known" men on the dating app Raya. However, he also said the experiences convinced him not to date famous men in the future.</p><h2 id=lil-nas-x-confirmed-his-relationship-with-dancer-yai-ariza-to-variety-in-2021>Lil Nas X Confirmed His Relationship With Dancer Yai Ariza To Variety In 2021</h2><p>In 2021, Montero was on top of the world. He had two of the biggest songs of the year with "Montero (Call Me By Your Name)" and "Industry Baby." He also released his self-titled debut album to impressive sales and rave reviews.</p><p>That same year, <a href=#>the singer opened up to Variety</a> when he graced the cover of their Power of Young Hollywood issue. In the article, Montero opened up about his own discovery that he was gay. He also talked about his first real relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was 18, I believe," Montero said. "Before that, there was a guy who wasn't my boyfriend, but we met in middle school and we talked, after we both found out that each other were gay. But I didn't act on anything until high school — well, middle school, but then high school."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar51920090.jpg><p>In October 2020, he revealed to CR Men that he was dating someone.</p><p>"I'm dating someone right now," he said. "We're not in a relationship yet, but it's been on and off for the past few months. I'm maybe going to try to go steady this time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's unclear if Montero was dating the same guy when speaking to Variety. However, he confirmed he was in a relationship when speaking to the outlet.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Lil Nas X's Recent Tour Is Receiving Major Praise</a></span></p><p>"I've had some good boyfriends and some bad ones. A lot of them were emotionally unavailable or had a lot of insecurity and whatnot," Montero said. "I've found someone special now. I think this is the one. I can't explain it — it's just a feeling."</p><p>The identity of Montero's mystery man turned out to be his backup dancer Yai Ariza, <a href=#>who he kissed on stage at the BET Awards</a> that same year. Ariza would also appear as Montero's love interest <a href=#>in his "That's What I Want" music video</a>.</p><h2 id=the-couple-split-that-same-year-and-montero-said-he-wasn-39-t-ready-for-relationships-just-yet>The Couple Split That Same Year And Montero Said He Wasn't Ready For Relationships Just Yet</h2><p>In October 2021, Montero confirmed the end of his relationship with Ariza <a href=#>in an interview with SiriusXM's Hits 1 LA</a>. Montero would later speak to GQ and reflect on the responsibility a relationship requires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's a responsibility. I've been wanting somebody for so long and wanting somebody to love for so long, but it's a real responsibility," Montero said. "And you have to give this person your time. And I like to go missing for like a week to focus … not talk to anyone and focus on myself. And I'm more in love with what I'm doing than people."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar50973827.jpg><p>Montero also made it clear that he didn't have any hard feelings toward his ex.</p><p>"I started actually dating my last boyfriend this past year, who I'm still on really good terms with," he said.

I feel it was the most serious relationship I've ever had."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, Montero sounded unsure whether he would be dating seriously in the near future.</p><p>"I feel I still want to hang out with guys every now and then," Montero said. "I don't want anything that's—not to be a whore or anything, but I don't want anything that's like, 'I need your time right now.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Lil Nas X And Jack Harlow's Relationship</a></span></p><p>He also said that he doesn't need to date just for the sake of affection.</p><p>"Sometimes, when you get sad or whatnot, you just want to go with somebody and cuddle and kiss and hug," he said. "And I love to do that. But ultimately, I feel I've gotten to a place where I have enough love for me that I can focus on myself."</p><p>Montero did conclude, however, that he isn't opposed to the idea of falling in love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When the time comes [for love], I'm not going to force it or anything," he said.

"It's very much like, tumbled off for myself and I just began to meet individuals face to face. Also, Raya is really popular, everybody's renowned on there. I've met many well known folks.
