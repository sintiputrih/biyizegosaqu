Lorna Byrne, born 25 March 1953, is an Irish author. She is also a peace ambassador.&nbsp;Her best-known work is her bestseller, Angels in My Hair (2008).&nbsp;A Message of Hope from Angels (2012) and Love from Heaven (2014) were both No.&nbsp;The UK Sunday Times Book Chart ranked No. 1&nbsp;Her books have been published in more than 50 countries and translated into 30 languages.&nbsp;Byrne claims that she is able to see spirits and angels on a daily basis.&nbsp;Many media outlets have featured her, including CNN, The Economist and The Observer.</p><p>Byrne supported Occupy Wall Street in 2011&nbsp;She attended the UN Climate Summit in 2014 and the People’s Climate March in 2015.&nbsp;She spent a lot of her time in 2014 and 2015 fostering unity among Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims in America. This was important for Byrne’s influence on American foreign policy in Middle East.</p><p>Media appearances in the United States have included a 2012 interview on CNN, and interviews in 2010 and 2012 on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory.</p><p>Byrne states that all religions have access to God, and no person should think theirs better than the others. She maintains that God and the angels would like all religions to worship together, each according to their own understanding, none trying to convert the others. “It needs to become normal for all of us, regardless of our education, our status in life or our method or place of prayer, to come together with open hearts — without any agenda — to pray to God in whatever way feels appropriate to us.”</p><p align=justify>Angels in My Hair is her memoir of her early marriage and life.&nbsp;Stairways to Heaven (2010) tells the story of her life after her husband’s death, including how she wrote her first book and became a well-known public figure.&nbsp;It contains details about angels working in the world, she states.&nbsp;The Angels’ Message of Hope is about the importance of hope in these difficult times.&nbsp;Love from Heaven discussed the issue of “lack of love” in today’s world. She also spoke out about the importance of loving yourself, which is essential for the ability to love others.&nbsp;For the first time, she stated that she can see the power of love the same way she sees angels.&nbsp;The Year With Angels (2016) assists readers in recognizing their spiritual side through the various seasons. It also includes photos of Ireland during the four seasons.&nbsp;Angels at my Fingertips is the sequel to Angels in my Hair and includes detailed descriptions of exercises to connect to guardian angels.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lorna Byrne</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lorna</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Byrne</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Writer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1953</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dublin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ireland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Joe Byrne</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Lorna Byrne ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In truth, by degrading angels we have been degrading ourselves.</p><p align=justify>Larry Dossey, MD., NY Times bestselling author, writes, “Since recorded history, certain individuals have sensed, seen, and conversed with angelic presences. Since we are appallingly ignorant about the nature of consciousness, it is premature to dismiss these reports as fantasies, which is too often done. Lorna Byrne’s ‘Angels in my Hair’ is captivating. It is both a challenge to skeptics and an inspiration to those whose experiences confirm transcendental realities.”</p><h2>Who is Lorna Byrne Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Lorna Byrne</strong> married to <strong>Joe Byrne </strong>.
