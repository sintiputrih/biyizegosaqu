He sells there. He has a huge farm with all his things.</p><p>“He has $1million worth of stuff he can sell. He’s set.

He is in touch with a producer who lives in <a href=#>Las Vegas</a>. Frank has sold him a lot of stuff for his ranch. He’s doing okay.”</p><h2>CONSERVATORSHIP</h2><p>As The U.S. Sun previously reported, Frank has <a href=#>been at a rehabilitation center</a> since he was released from the <a href=#>hospital</a> on September 6.&nbsp;</p><p>The guardian visits Frank weekly in person.&nbsp;</p><p>The guardian’s responsibility will be to "facilitate all care needs, provide transportation to all medical appointments and help with all social and domestic needs.”</p><p>By the time of Frank’s discharge from the rehabilitation center, his Iowa farmhouse must have “ramps,” and “handles” for the shower and toilet.&nbsp;</p><p>The guardian will help Frank with his Crohn's disease treatment and continued physical therapy.&nbsp;</p><p>He will also help the former American Pickers star grocery shop, cook and “get Frank to any activity he feels up to.”</p><h2 id=block-541f8251-5dda-4697-857e-41b299b66de9>FRANK'S NEW LIFE</h2><p id=block-5ec2edc3-bfca-4e72-8121-c783f52fcdf9>The U.S. Sun previously

injury or illness may occur.</p><p id=block-76085c62-eba3-4d36-b650-4424a3eaf759>“Mr. Fritz’s decision­making capacity is so impaired that he is unable to make, communicate, or carry out important decisions concerning his own financial affairs.”</p><p id=block-63ff9ada-d7d2-4dbd-801a-e1a4aacc0d01>An exhibit was mentioned in the court papers from a doctor, confirming Frank “does not have

id=block-a5f94470-a795-4f8d-9214-e7ea92048af4>The Petitioner requested a separate “longtime friend” of Frank’s, who “has been assisting him in decision-making since the stroke,” be his guardian.&nbsp;</p><p id=block-35126ec3-27fd-455e-ba33-3d9627223e5f>A bank would be the conservator to handle Frank’s financial affairs.</p><p id=block-4c687e87-e9bd-4031-b761-b0e914594def>The

responsibilities.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=block-65e46335-28ca-48aa-8a67-0b18dc15fae3>MEDICAL CRISIS</h2><p id=block-e161c822-7bca-4c34-b6d5-39e74890921b>Frank was <a href=# rel="noreferrer
