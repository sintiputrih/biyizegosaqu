Born on January 24, 1953, in Manhattan, this American <a href=#>musician</a>, record producer, singer-songwriter, and composer has had an illustrious career both as a folk singer in the ’70s and as a prominent producer and songwriter in subsequent years. Over the decades, he has created some timeless musical classics that still resonate deeply with listeners today.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/mediacoverage.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/matthew-wilder-info.jpg alt width=1344 height=896 sizes="(max-width: 1344px) 100vw, 1344px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Wilder rose to fame as part of Matthew & Peter in the early 70s. The duo released one album called “Under the Arch,” which showcased their rich vocal harmonies beautifully. However, it was not until he moved to Los Angeles at the end of the decade that he found success singing for TV commercials and backing established artists like Rickie Lee Jones and Bette Midler.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Person Name:</th><td>Matthew Wilder</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth:</th><td>$18 million</td></tr><tr><th>Date of Birth:</th><td>January 24, 1953</td></tr><tr><th>Place of Birth:</th><td>Manhattan, New York</td></tr><tr><th>Gender:</th><td>Male</td></tr><tr><th>Profession:</th><td>Musician, Record Producer, Singer-Songwriter, Composer</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1981 he signed with Clive Davis’ Arista Records, marking a significant turning point in his career. Two years later, Wilder released his debut solo album “I Don’t Speak the Language,” which peaked at #49 on Billboard 200 chart. The standout single from that album, “Break My Stride,” became a global hit reaching #5 on Billboard Hot 100 chart; it’s been featured countless times across movies and TV shows since.</p><p>Despite continued success with other singles like “The Kid’s American,” Wilder faced setbacks after his second LP’s release ‘Bouncin’ Off The Walls’, which didn’t perform as expected.</p><h2>Matthew Wilder’s Net Worth: A Combination of Talents and Shrewd Investments</h2><p>However, Wilder’s talent soon caught up again when he transitioned towards production and songwriting for other artists. He produced albums for some influential artists like No Doubt’s smash breakthrough album “Tragic Kingdom”, Kelly Clarkson’s iconic hits- ‘Breakaway’ , Christina Aguilera’s critically acclaimed self-titled debut album among many others throughout his career. He also wrote Aguilera’s song ‘Reflection’ for Disney’s Mulan animation movie soundtrack responsible for creating one of the most iconic ballads in Disney history.</p>Ver esta publicación en Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Una publicación compartida de Matthew Wilder (@matthewwildermusic)</a></p><p>Away from music-related deals, Wilder has been juggling personal life investments and managing to strike gold here too, buying and selling high-value estates. In 2013, one of his purchases a sprawling seven-acre property in Malibu for $6.85 million proved sizeable, as he bought next door’s undeveloped land at $2.4 million immediately after it priced double the purchase amount – $6.8 million- selling it off actor Liam Hemsworth four years later.</p><p>Moreover, in June of last year, Wilder bought Hemsworth’s ex-wife Miley Cyrus’s home for $1.7 million dollars in Malibu where the songwriter and his wife still own and are yet to fit into the still undeveloped second parcel of land purchased beside Liam’s burnt lot.</p><p>Matthew Wilder’s career has seen noteworthy musical contributions lead to multiplying fortunes that have brought him an estimated net worth of around $18 million. Despite ups and downs in both personal life and musical journey as a whole continuing until this day., he remains highly respected within the industry as one of the trailblazers who shaped contemporary pop music – not just through his work as an artist but also through his astute investments leading him to secure massive profits.` Serving as inspiration, Matthew Wilder will forever be remembered for his passion for music-making coupled with business acumen resulting fruitful results that encompassed every aspect of life – musical or non-musical alike.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Matthew Wilder’s net worth is a significant aspect of his success, as it is estimated to be around $18 million. A major portion of this sum comes from his career as a musician, where he produced successful albums and singles. However, in addition to music-related income, Wilder has proven himself to be an astute investor. He has invested in high-valued real estate properties, such as the seven-acre Malibu property that he purchased for $6.85 million.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/mediacoverage.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/matthew-wilder-earnings.jpg alt width=1344 height=896 sizes="(max-width: 1344px) 100vw, 1344px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In one example of his success, he bought an undeveloped plot next door for $2.4 million and then sold it off to actor Liam Hemsworth four years later for double the purchase price—$6.8 million. Furthermore, Wilder recently purchased Miley Cyrus’s former home in Malibu for $1.7 million and still owns its undeveloped second parcel of land which was purchased beside Liam’s burnt lot and not yet developed or utilized in any way. Overall, Wilder’s accomplishments demonstrate how a combination of talent and shrewd investments can lead to significant financial prosperity over time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZm2oq%2FOr5yrmZeae6S7zGikmqyknbK4edaio52domK7psCMsKarrJhirm64yJ%2BcZqeWYrq2v8icmKVn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmatthew-wilder-net-worth-a-life-of-musical.html&text=Matthew%20Wilder%20Net%20Worth%3a%20A%20Life%20of%20Musical%20Success%20and%20Astute%20Investments&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatthew-wilder-net-worth-a-life-of-musical.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatthew-wilder-net-worth-a-life-of-musical.html&title=Matthew%20Wilder%20Net%20Worth%3a%20A%20Life%20of%20Musical%20Success%20and%20Astute%20Investments" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmatthew-wilder-net-worth-a-life-of-musical.html&title=Matthew%20Wilder%20Net%20Worth%3a%20A%20Life%20of%20Musical%20Success%20and%20Astute%20Investments" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmatthew-wilder-net-worth-a-life-of-musical.html&title=Matthew%20Wilder%20Net%20Worth%3a%20A%20Life%20of%20Musical%20Success%20and%20Astute%20Investments" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatthew-wilder-net-worth-a-life-of-musical.html&description=Matthew%20Wilder%20Net%20Worth%3a%20A%20Life%20of%20Musical%20Success%20and%20Astute%20Investments" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./maureen-jensen-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-634615-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maureen Jensen Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./leilani-lutali-refused-kidney-transplant-jamiee-fougner-because-both-unvaccinated-against-covid.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Leilani Lutali REFUSED kidney transplant Jamiee Fougner because both unvaccinated against COVID">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
