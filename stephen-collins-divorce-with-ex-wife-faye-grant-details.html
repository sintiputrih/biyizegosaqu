According to E!

According to TMZ, Mark Vincent Kaplan, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collins' lawyer, stated Grant was using the recording to get money from Collins.</a> "Faye has repeatedly threatened to give this audiotape to the media, unless Stephen agreed to pay her millions of dollars more than to which she was legally entitled."</p><p>"It appears that she has finally found an audience for this tape.

"The recording was made by Faye solely to benefit herself, and she did not have any altruistic motives at all."</p><p>"This was evident in her emails to Stephen immediately after Stephen left the family residence, as she sent a series of emails asking him to pay what she was requesting so as to preclude her from 'taking him to the cleaners.'"</p><p>Collins' lawyer also wanted to prove that Grant was reason the tape was released to the press. "While Faye might be confident that because no photograph exists of her handing the recording to the receptionist at TMZ, she therefore can say she didn't give the recording to TMZ, she certainly shouldn't be found without responsibility for maintaining the custodial privacy of her copies of the recording in a way to assure they wouldn't get into the public domain."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to a different People article, Collins stated in court papers that he shouldn't have to pay Grant $13,000 to support her, "as a result of the unlawful recording that was disseminated to the media."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What The Disgraced Dad From 7th Heaven, Stephen Collins, Is Doing Now</a></span></p><p>Grant's statement to ABC News denied she released the recording to the press.

I sincerely hope Stephen gets the help he needs."</p><p>The two finally finalized their divorce in 2015. According to E!
