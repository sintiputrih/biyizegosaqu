By this time, Tracy and Kevin had called it quits, and once Michael realized she was single, he decided to ask her out.&nbsp;</p><p id=eA8qBzDhK6Q data-wc=36>"It sounds really horrible, but it was one of those things," he told People in 1989.

During an appearance on Inside the Actor's Studio, she recalled: "I think I thought he was kind of full of himself.
