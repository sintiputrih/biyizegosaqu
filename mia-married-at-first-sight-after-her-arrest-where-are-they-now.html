Fans have naturally grown curious about where the reality TV star is today.</p><p>Let's check in and hear about the latest with Mia Bally from Married at First Sight.</p><h2 id=39-married-at-first-sight-39-is-a-popular-series>'Married At First Sight' Is A Popular Series</h2><p>Married at First Sight is easily one of the wildest concepts for a reality show in history, and it has kept viewers hooked for years now. Instead of seeing who can make it to the end and eventually get married, this show sees strangers getting married at the beginning and then seeing if they want to stay together or get a divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couples are paired together with the help of relationship experts, and when the experts get it right, they really get it right. There have been some couples who seemed destined to be with one another. However, on the other end of the spectrum are the couples that seem to have no business being anywhere near each other. It's a gamble for everyone on the show, but when it pays off, a contestant winds up being introduced to the person that they were meant to share their life with.</p><p>During the show's time on the small screen, there have been a number of infamous contestants who have made headlines for all the wrong reasons. This includes Mia, who took part in season seven of the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Why 'Married At First Sight' Couple Ryan Oubre And Clara Berghaus Divorced</a></span></p><h2 id=mia-was-arrested-on-season-7>Mia Was Arrested On Season 7</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During season seven of the show, things seemed to be moving along quite normally, but everything changed in the blink of an eye when Tristan and Mia were getting ready to go on their honeymoon. Before getting the chance to leave, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mia was arrested</a>, and it was discovered that she was scooped up for stalking charges.</p><p>From that point on, everything was completely different between Mia and Tristan, and it was difficult for the couple to overcome what had taken place early on. They tried their best to make things work, but unfortunately, nothing that they did was enough to make things solid in the long run.</p><p>After deciding to split up, the duo underwent divorce proceedings, and everything was finalized back in 2018.</p><p>Per InStyle, "The petition for the divorce read 'The marriage has become insupportable due to discord or conflict of personalities that destroys the legitimate ends of the marital relationship and prevents any reasonable expectation of reconciliation.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It has been several years since the fallout between Mia and Tristan took place, and many people are wondering what the reality star is up to these days.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Married At First Sight’: The Only Couple From Season 13 Who Are Still Together</a></span></p><h2 id=mia-has-started-a-family>Mia Has Started A Family</h2><p>So, what in the world has Mia Bally been up to since her time on the show? Well, she has been active on social media, and she has clued fans in about important life events that have taken place.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monsters & Critics</a> back in October, "Mia finally found her happy ending too.

Needless to say, fans were excited for her, especially after all that she endured while on the show.</p><p>As for her former partner, Tristan, well, life has been kind to him, too. The same site reports that "Tristan and his wife Rachel got married in July of 2020, despite the pandemic conditions, the two were able to have a ceremony and it turned out beautifully according to the pictures."</p><p>Much like Mia, Tristan is a parent now, and he and his family unit seem to be doing quite well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Married At First Sight': Are Myrla And Johnny Really Dating?</a></span></p><p>Considering all that these two dealt with during their time on the show, it is really refreshing to learn that they are both at a great place in their lives.
