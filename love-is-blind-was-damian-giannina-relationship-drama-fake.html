But over time, the drama ramped up, leading fans to believe the couple was a total mess.</p><p>The drama culminated in a wedding day disaster, where Giannina said I Do but Damian said I Don't.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Which 'Love Is Blind' Cast Member Has The Highest Net Worth?">Which 'Love Is Blind' Cast Member Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>The follow-up to the season finale established that the two continued dating after their not-wedding, for quite some time. And while <a href=#>Giannina seemed to avoid addressing the breakup rumors</a> directly, it seems things finally fizzled out off-screen. But was the relationship really as toxic as it seemed on air?</p><h2 id=damian-and-giannina-were-off-to-a-great-start-at-first>Damian And Giannina Were Off To A Great Start... At First</h2><p>Damian and Gigi were flirty at first, seemingly smitten, and things were fantastic. But later, particularly after their honeymoon, the two started having spats at home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><p>There were arguments that involved digs at Damian's prowess in the bedroom, and various complaints from both partners about the relationship. Yet they seemed to patch it up, and continued to head toward the aisle.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Are Luana And Lissio From 'Love Is Blind: Brazil' Still Together?">Are Luana And Lissio From 'Love Is Blind: Brazil' Still Together?</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, though, Giannina's wedding day turned into a mud-stained mess, with her grooming noping out of the marriage.</p><h2 id=why-didn-39-t-damian-and-giannina-get-married>Why Didn't Damian And Giannina Get Married?</h2><p>At the reunion, Damian admitted that he said, "I don't" at the aisle because he assumed Giannina would like to date outside of the show.</p><p>“It was definitely a strong love from the beginning. We pushed through a lot of challenges, as did everyone here," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he stated at the time</a>. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He also said</a>, “but I wanted it everyday ever since I told her I loved her in The Pods. It turned into our love story, but she was in and out of it so much.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So why break things off then? From Damian's quotes, it sounds like their relationship wasn't as bad as fans assumed from their on-screen feuding. Especially after Damian brought a "friend," whom he'd already been photographed with when Gigi wasn't around, to the season one reunion party.</p><p>The friend, a former reality star herself, didn't seem to realize that Giannina and Damian were still together, which of course provided plenty of fodder for the episode's drama.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="The Truth About The Cast Salaries On 'Love Is Blind'">The Truth About The Cast Salaries On 'Love Is Blind'</a></span></p><p>Yet after the series aired, the two stuck together, and that third wheel was nowhere to be found.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><h2 id=damian-and-giannina-39-s-breakup-wasn-39-t-that-bad>Damian And Giannina's Breakup Wasn't That Bad</h2><p>Despite the drama on the show, quotes from both Giannina and Damian suggest that they split on relatively decent terms. In fact, neither has deleted photos of the other from their respective Instagrams, though <a href=#>their last pics together were circa 2020</a>.</p><p>And for a while, <a href=#>fans suspected the pair even secretly married</a> — that's how chill they seemed about each other. Then, in an interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gigi even stated that the pair had both moved on</a>.</p><p>She added, “For the first time in, like, three years I feel like I don’t have to keep some sort of my life private anymore. We were just under wraps about everything. I was still trying to figure out, how does my life look without him in it? It’s been a long time, but I feel really good. I’ve processed it all. I’m such at peace.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I don’t regret anything. You definitely learn from all different kinds of love," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giannina told ET</a> about what she took away from their engagement.</p><p>"I definitely learned from that. In a relationship, we were just very different, and I think that’s very clear. There’s nothing wrong with that, opposites really attract, but with us, it’s just I guess the way that we communicated, we didn’t really understand what the other was trying to say. It was constantly like that.”</p><p>While the couple had "really great moments," Giannina informed ET that “at the end of the day, we just weren’t as compatible as we should have been after dating for two years."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="The Behind-The-Scenes Romances Of ‘Love Is Blind’ Season 2">The Behind-The-Scenes Romances Of ‘Love Is Blind’ Season 2</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijqK6VYra0ecGloKecXayutHnDmqSimZ5itKqtzaegp5ldp7KtrdOipqermJ69brDRmqSaZZaWuKZ7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flove-is-blind-was-damian-giannina-relationship-drama-fake.html&text=Hints%20That%20Damian%20And%20Giannina%27s%20Relationship%20Drama%20Was%20Fake&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flove-is-blind-was-damian-giannina-relationship-drama-fake.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flove-is-blind-was-damian-giannina-relationship-drama-fake.html&title=Hints%20That%20Damian%20And%20Giannina%27s%20Relationship%20Drama%20Was%20Fake" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flove-is-blind-was-damian-giannina-relationship-drama-fake.html&title=Hints%20That%20Damian%20And%20Giannina%27s%20Relationship%20Drama%20Was%20Fake" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flove-is-blind-was-damian-giannina-relationship-drama-fake.html&title=Hints%20That%20Damian%20And%20Giannina%27s%20Relationship%20Drama%20Was%20Fake" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flove-is-blind-was-damian-giannina-relationship-drama-fake.html&description=Hints%20That%20Damian%20And%20Giannina%27s%20Relationship%20Drama%20Was%20Fake" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jake-funk-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jake Funk  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./emma-stone-silver-slip-dress-lilac-duster-poor-things-screening-8416380.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emma Stone Took a Surprising Approach to Holiday Dressing in a Silver Slip Dress and Lilac Duster">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
