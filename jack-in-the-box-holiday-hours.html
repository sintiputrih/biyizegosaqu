While it is open for most of the year, the company does observe certain holidays and may have different hours of operation on those days.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I decided to take a closer look at the Jack in the Box Holiday Hours, including which holidays the company observes and what the hours of operation are on those days.</p><h2><span id=An_Overview_of_Jack_in_the_Box>An Overview of Jack in the Box</span></h2><p>Jack in the Box was founded in 1951, and the company has a long history of providing quick and convenient meals to customers. Since its inception, it has been known for its burgers, chicken sandwiches, and tacos, as well as a variety of sides and drinks. The chain is also known for its drive-thru service, which allows customers to order and receive their food without leaving their cars.</p><p>In addition to its classic menu items, it also offers a variety of seasonal and limited-time offerings. For example, the chain has introduced menu items such as pumpkin spice lattes and turkey burgers during the fall and Thanksgiving, respectively.</p><h3><span id=They_have_a_mascot_too>They have a mascot too!</span></h3><p>Jack in the Box branches are known for their fun and playful branding, which includes a mascot named Jack, who is a clown with a round head and a beanie. Customers can earn rewards by joining “Jack’s Pack,” which allows them to earn points for every purchase and redeem them for exclusive offers and discounts.</p><h2><span id=Regular_Operating_Hours>Regular Operating Hours</span></h2><p>The restaurant is known for its late-night hours.&nbsp;<strong>Jack in the Box operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week</strong>, at most of its locations. This means that customers can visit the restaurant at any time of the day or night to grab a quick meal or snack.</p><h3><span id=But_are_all_locations_open_24_hours_a_day>But are all locations open 24 hours a day?</span></h3><p>Not all Jack in the Box locations are open 24 hours a day. A few have limited hours of operation, such as being open from 6:00 a.m. to midnight.</p><h2><span id=Jack_in_the_Box_Holiday_Hours>Jack in the Box Holiday Hours</span></h2><h3><span id=1nbspNew_Years_Day><code>1</code>&nbsp;New Year’s Day</span></h3><p><strong>On New Year’s Day, all Jack in the Box locations are open 24 hours</strong>. This means you can enjoy your favorite fast food items any time of day, whether you’re celebrating the start of the new year or just need a late-night snack.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/New-Year’s-Day.png alt="New Year’s Day" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span id=2nbspValentines_Day><code>2</code>&nbsp;Valentine’s Day</span></h3><p><strong>Jack in the Box is also open 24 hours on Valentine’s Day</strong>, so you can surprise your loved one with a special meal or treat yourself to something delicious.</p><h3><span id=3nbspEaster><code>3</code>&nbsp;Easter</span></h3><p>Easter is a holiday that falls on a different date each year. Whenever the date, even on Easter Sunday, Jack in the Box is open 24 hours as usual.</p><h3><span id=4nbspMemorial_Day><code>4</code>&nbsp;Memorial Day</span></h3><p>On Memorial Day, all locations are open 24 hours. This is a great opportunity to grab a quick bite to eat while you’re out enjoying the holiday.</p><h3><span id=5nbspIndependence_Day><code>5</code>&nbsp;Independence Day</span></h3><p>On&nbsp;<strong>Independence Day (4th of July), Jack in the Box locations are typically open</strong>, but the hours of operation may vary. Some locations may be open for a limited time, while others may be open for their normal 24-hour business hours.</p><h3><span id=6nbspLabor_Day><code>6</code>&nbsp;Labor Day</span></h3><p>Like Memorial Day, Jack in the Box is open 24 hours on Labor Day. This is a perfect opportunity to grab a quick bite to eat while you’re out enjoying the holiday.</p><h3><span id=7nbspThanksgiving><code>7</code>&nbsp;Thanksgiving</span></h3><p><strong>Jack in the Box is also open 24 hours on Thanksgiving</strong>, so you can celebrate America’s harvest feast with a delicious meal or snack any time of day.</p><h3><span id=8nbspChristmas_Day><code>8</code>&nbsp;Christmas Day</span></h3><p><strong>Jack in the Box is closed on Christmas Day</strong>, but you can still enjoy their menu on Christmas Eve.</p><p>It is important to note that the holiday hours may vary by location. Several restaurants may run “modified hours,” which often exclude midnight operation. As such, it is always a good idea to check with your local restaurant to confirm their hours on a specific holiday.</p><h2><span id=What_Should_You_Do_if_You_Need_To_Visit_Jack_in_the_Box_on_a_Holiday>What Should You Do if You Need To Visit Jack in the Box on a Holiday?</span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/What-Should-You-Do-if-You-Need-To-Visit-Jack-in-the-Box-on-a-Holiday.png alt="What Should You Do if You Need To Visit Jack in the Box on a Holiday" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>If your local restaurant is closed, there are a few options you can consider:</p><ul><li><i class="sui sui-check"></i> Check to see if there are any other Jack in the Box locations in your area that are open on the holiday.
