Ultimately, their on-again-off-again relationship ended with a mutual plan to settle down and have a family.</p><p class=dh>Jake Paul has an on-again, off-again relationship with Julia Rose, a famous Instagram model. While Rose's boyfriend initially gained fame through social media, she had a different way of cementing her name publicly.</p><p class=dh>Known as the "World Series Flasher," Rose became known when she and Lauren Summer lifted their tops to flash Gerrit Cole of the Houston Astros. The inappropriate incident happened in 2019, during the fifth game of the MLB World Series.</p><p class=dh>According to Rose, exposing her bare body was a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/12328944/jake-paul-ex-girlfriend-julia-rose/>publicity stunt</a> to promote Shagmag, her magazine. She and her friend have since been barred from entering US-held baseball games.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>How Did Julia Rose Start Dating Jake Paul?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Rose and Paul were first linked in 2020 after they met on a music video production for "These Days" in 2019. What started as an on-screen love interest became a real-life romance for the YouTube star and Instagram model.</p><p class=dh>According to Paul, it was love at first sight when they met, and he spared no time confessing his feelings. "It was like six hours we spent together, and so I literally just told her, 'I love you,'" he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/julia-rose-jake-paul-relationship-timeline-4800010/>said</a>.</p><p class=dh>In March 2020, Paul told their love story to his social media followers, making his fans even more interested to know Rose. However, they had an unexpected breakup at the start of 2022.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Jake Paul and Julia Rose's Unexpected Breakup</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Speculation of their breakup began when Paul hinted at his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/2022/03/08/jake-paul-and-instagram-model-julia-rose-break-up/>relationship</a> status on Twitter. Sources also confirmed that Paul and Rose were officially broken up, leaving the influencer distraught.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Rose supported Paul in several ways, including when he decided to pursue a boxing career. She also had nothing but kind words to say about her boyfriend, revealing that he was selfless and generous.</strong></h3><p class=dh>According to insiders, Paul still loved Rose and wanted to mend their love, but it was not the right time. Paul later revealed that he and Rose needed a break from each other, hence their decision to call it quits.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Jake Paul and Julia Rose's Reunite</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>It didn't take long for the duo to realize they wanted to fix their relationship. Paul and Rose were spotted cozying up to each other again, and it seemed they were planning to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-11136511/YouTube-star-turned-fighter-Jake-Paul-drops-bombshell-baby-news-model-girlfriend-Julia-Rose.html>settle down</a> already. During an interview, Paul <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UgiCB4Lq4w&t=686s">said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Julia and I are actually having conversations on, like, when to get pregnant [...]. She's my support system, as well, like emotional support and all that, someone I can lean on, and you know we're wanting to start a family."</p><p class=dh>Rose supported Paul in several ways, including when he decided to pursue a boxing career. She also had nothing but <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://nypost.com/2022/10/29/the-side-of-jake-paul-girlfriend-julia-rose-is-trying-get-him-to-show-the-world/>kind words</a> to say about her boyfriend, revealing that he was selfless and generous.</p><p class=dh>Speaking to the New York Post, Rose noted her hopes to have Paul show his soft side to the public one day. She is doing her part to push him out of his comfort zone and be less afraid to show his big heart to others.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Jake Paul</a> is known in boxing for his strong personality, taunting his opponents online. Previously, Paul beat former UFC welterweight champion, Tyron Woodley in a boxing match that lasted eight rounds.</p><p class=dh>It was close and balanced, matched with Paul taking an aggressive approach, which may have caused the scoring-based win. Paul also found success in his first boxing competition against YouTuber AnEsonGib and second match against former NBA athlete Nate Robinson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcG9pbHqrrcqeZKmZpaF6qbXSZp6iqpybv6qxzZ1kq52RmcZuv9Oaqa1lkWKzb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f297797-jake-paul-his-girlfriend-ready-start-a-f-html.html&text=Jake%20Paul%20%26amp%3b%20His%20Girlfriend%20Ready%20to%20Start%20a%20Family%20after%20Split%20%26amp%3b%20Getting%20Back%20Together%20%20More%20abou&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f297797-jake-paul-his-girlfriend-ready-start-a-f-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f297797-jake-paul-his-girlfriend-ready-start-a-f-html.html&title=Jake%20Paul%20%26amp%3b%20His%20Girlfriend%20Ready%20to%20Start%20a%20Family%20after%20Split%20%26amp%3b%20Getting%20Back%20Together%20%20More%20abou" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f297797-jake-paul-his-girlfriend-ready-start-a-f-html.html&title=Jake%20Paul%20%26amp%3b%20His%20Girlfriend%20Ready%20to%20Start%20a%20Family%20after%20Split%20%26amp%3b%20Getting%20Back%20Together%20%20More%20abou" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f297797-jake-paul-his-girlfriend-ready-start-a-f-html.html&title=Jake%20Paul%20%26amp%3b%20His%20Girlfriend%20Ready%20to%20Start%20a%20Family%20after%20Split%20%26amp%3b%20Getting%20Back%20Together%20%20More%20abou" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f297797-jake-paul-his-girlfriend-ready-start-a-f-html.html&description=Jake%20Paul%20%26amp%3b%20His%20Girlfriend%20Ready%20to%20Start%20a%20Family%20after%20Split%20%26amp%3b%20Getting%20Back%20Together%20%20More%20abou" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./yfn-lucci-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Songs Albums News Lyrics Parents">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./floyd-mayweather-car-collection-vegas-mansion-rolls-royce-lambo-maybach.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              Floyd Mayweather Shows Off Insane Car Collection, Royces, Lambos &amp;amp; Ma">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
