During their time together, Cena also saw Wyatt as someone who was very much like him in a number of ways.</p><p>Bray Wyatt and John Cena had a famous Firefly Fun House match at WrestleMania with zero fans present, and that was quite a cinematic masterpiece. John Cena and Bray Wyatt didn’t even need to get physical in that encounter to tell a great story.</p><p>While speaking to <a href=#>WWE’s YouTube channel</a>, John Cena spoke about Bray Wyatt and that Firefly Fun House match. He said that he and Wyatt were “cut from the same cloth” and he had amazing things to say about the late Eater of Worlds.</p><p>“I really enjoyed performing with Bray. We were cut from the same cloth in that regard. Both storytellers and both wanting to do bizarre things, and I think we, him and I, have always tried to do different things, and we’ve embraced each other’s creativity. Using the child at the door of the cage, the Firefly Fun House match, those are ideas that come from a unique individual. I always loved Windham’s creativity. He never strictly leaned on the physicality of anything. He was always about the art and the story.”&nbsp;</p><p>Bray Wyatt was taken far too soon, and he had so many stories left to tell. Sadly, he will never get to finish out all of his plans, but he certainly left a ton of memories in the process.</p><p>We are still sending our deepest thoughts to JoJo Offerman, Bray Wyatt’s children, and all of his friends and family. With the holidays coming up, this must be hard to go it without him around, but he will certainly always be in their hearts. John Cena also will never forget about the time he spent with Bray Wyatt.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your take on Bray Wyatt and John Cena’s chemistry in the ring?
