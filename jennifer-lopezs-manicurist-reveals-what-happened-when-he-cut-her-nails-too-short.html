Many times we custom mix her color on the spot for that perfect shade to complete the look and always create new designs and looks that resonate with her personal J.Lo style.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Some of the go-to trends they’re into now are included in Bachik’s <a href=#>LVX Red Carpet Color Nail Kit</a>,&nbsp;which features classic colors including a deep red, a nude, a pink and a shimmer shade.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Jen loves a classic nude color and almond shape because of how elegantly chic they look, but she definitely loves a bit of bling too,” Bachik says.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>While the “On the Floor” songstress loves to experiment with a variety of looks, one thing she isn’t a fan of is super short nails.<br></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Once I cut all of Jennifers nails off because I wasn’t paying attention,” Bachik admits. “Jennifer was heading out on the European leg of her tour for a couple months and before she left, we shortened her nails to start as I wouldn’t be with her and could only arrange for a nail tech to meet her in certain stops. A couple months later when she returned, her nails had grown really long and she was so proud and loved them, but it had been a bit since her last polish and they had grown out. I asked her what she was thinking for length and color. As we shared late night milk and cookies she said, ‘Take them back to where they were.’ Being a guy, I heard her, but wasn’t really listening to her,” he jokes.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jennifer-Lopez-Manicurist-Tom-Bachik-03.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“She had meant take them back to the little bit they had grown out since her last polish, but I heard, ‘Take them back to where they were,’ which was really short before she left. I proceeded to take her hand and chop all her nails off and got to the fourth finger before she realized what was happening. … Oh, the look on her face,” the celebrity manicurist teases. “For the next few weeks I had to endure, ‘And then Tom cut all my nails off!’ We still laugh about it!”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>To help others avoid future nail dilemmas, Bachik launched the <a href=#>LVX Restoration Nail Treatment Set</a>, available on QVC</span><span class=s1>, that includes a recover nail strengthener with horsetail to smooth and restore moisture, a revive non-yellowing quick dry top coat to refresh your look and a revive cuticle oil with a blend of Sunflower, Jojoba, Argan, Camellia oils and vitamin E to rehydrate and condition nails and skin.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jennifer-Lopez-Nails-Inline.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“With all of the&nbsp;</span><a href=#>at home gel and dip removals and requests I received due to COVID-19</a>, I saw the need for a nail recovery kit to help smooth, strengthen and rehydrate nails and skin,” he shares.</p><p>Other than that one slip-up, Bachik and the Grammy nominee’s relationship has been smooth sailing and treasured by both of them.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I love getting to support Jen in all the amazing things she does.
