He is neither seen with any girl nor are there any pictures of him getting married.</p><p>But, the curious fans gossip that he may be privately wedded, whereas some even say that he has a gay partner taking some photos as evidence.</p><p>In contrast, he has heavily criticized such accusations by the internet buzz who tweeted about him being gay. Despite such criticisms, the entertainer remains tight-lipped and has not disclosed any information about his wife or girlfriend.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=explore-his-net-worth-as-of-2021></span>Explore his Net Worth as of 2021<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Josh Mcdermitt’s net worth is estimated to be $3 million at present.

However, some sources claim that he had been in a relationship once.</p><p>He was seeing someone for a year but they were not engaged. Who was he dating or what happened afterward remains a mystery.</p><p>It seems he does not like to publicize his personal life and stays lowkey. In addition, he has deleted all his social media account because of online abuse regarding his role in the movie in 2017 after season seven was aired. It has been more difficult to know about his whereabouts afterward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yjpqygXaKwpbHRpqCtrF2stqexjKCgq6SWp7amusNmoKxlmJp6rq3Rq6CenF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-josh-mcdermitt-wife-girlfriend-is-he-married.html&text=Who%20Is%20Josh%20Mcdermitt%20Wife%3f%20Girlfriend%20%20Is%20He%20Married%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-josh-mcdermitt-wife-girlfriend-is-he-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-josh-mcdermitt-wife-girlfriend-is-he-married.html&title=Who%20Is%20Josh%20Mcdermitt%20Wife%3f%20Girlfriend%20%20Is%20He%20Married%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-josh-mcdermitt-wife-girlfriend-is-he-married.html&title=Who%20Is%20Josh%20Mcdermitt%20Wife%3f%20Girlfriend%20%20Is%20He%20Married%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-josh-mcdermitt-wife-girlfriend-is-he-married.html&title=Who%20Is%20Josh%20Mcdermitt%20Wife%3f%20Girlfriend%20%20Is%20He%20Married%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-josh-mcdermitt-wife-girlfriend-is-he-married.html&description=Who%20Is%20Josh%20Mcdermitt%20Wife%3f%20Girlfriend%20%20Is%20He%20Married%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./when-was-love-and-hip-hop-family-reunion-filmed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'VH1 Family Reunion: Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop Edition' Cast Filmed Before the New Year in Arizona">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./anastasia-romanov.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Daughter Of Russia's Last Czar">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
